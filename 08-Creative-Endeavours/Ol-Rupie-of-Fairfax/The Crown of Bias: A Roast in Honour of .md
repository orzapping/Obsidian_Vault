The Crown of Bias: A Roast in Honour of Sky Sports F1’s Glorious Delusions

Ah, Sky Sports F1 — that hallowed temple of motorsport journalism where impartiality allegedly resides, embalmed, somewhere between the 
commercial breaks and the last surviving copy of Murray Walker’s dignity. If one were to enter its commentary booth expecting a fair 
assessment of events on track, one might find themselves rather like a Frenchman at a full English breakfast: bemused, uninvited, and 
about to be condescended to by someone with suspiciously strong opinions about flags.

Take this morning’s Las Vegas Grand Prix. A spectacle of neon and noise, yes, but beneath the glitter lay the usual stench of Anglo-punditry 
masquerading as objective analysis. As the lights went out, young Lando Norris — knight-in-waiting to the Sky F1 round table — launched 
from pole like a man possessed. Or rather, like a man panicked to be next to Max Verstappen.

Now, our dear Lando, in an astonishing display of over-eagerness and karting-level spatial delusion, attempted to lunge across Verstappen’s 
line into Turn 1. Alas, like many a brave but ill-advised British military manoeuvre before it, the effort ended in humiliation: Max 
retained the lead, and Lando promptly handed second place away like a complimentary biscuit at a Premier Inn.

Did this prompt analysis? Critique? A moment of honest reckoning?

No, no. Enter Sir Jenson of Buttonshire — resplendent in faux-objective commentary, declaring Lando’s dive “appropriately aggressive” and 
“clever.” One would think the lad had reinvented overtaking. Not a peep about the fact he binned two positions before the second corner. 
Not even a raised eyebrow. One could almost hear the Queen’s ghost sobbing into her gin.

And then… the disqualification. Post-race scrutineering discovers both McLarens in breach of plank wear regulations. This is not merely a 
rule violation — it is mechanical dereliction, an error in setup and discipline. But how was it received by the Sky Sports echo chamber?

Oh, the anguish! The moaning! The “disappointment for the fans,” the pained insistence that it was all so terribly unfair. Were the cars 
legal? No. Was the punishment consistent with precedent? Yes. Did they ever express similar despair when Red Bull was handed penalties in 
the past?

Absolutely bloody not.

But ah — Verstappen. There he was again. Perfect start. Commanding lead. A display of mechanical sympathy, strategic nous, and unflinching 
consistency. And yet — and yet — when the commentators finally remembered to acknowledge him, it was with the same energy one uses to 
compliment a cousin you hate at Christmas dinner.

They do not praise Verstappen; they concede his excellence, as one might begrudgingly admire the military efficiency of Napoleon whilst 
still rooting for Wellington. Every compliment is an audible ulcer. Every “Well, Max was faultless today” sounds like a hostage note read 
at gunpoint. You can hear their jaws grinding through enamel as they spit out the words.

This, of course, is nothing new. The Sky F1 gang operate on a delightful little pyramid scheme of nationalism: British driver good. Other 
driver suspicious. Verstappen? Dutch interloper and existential threat to the Hamilton redemption arc. Clearly a villain.

Even when Verstappen wins, which he does with such alarming regularity it’s beginning to feel Biblical, they don’t celebrate it. They 
explain it — as though they’re reading out the side-effects of a strong medication:

“Yes, I suppose he did win again, and yes, I suppose it was rather dominant, and yes, I suppose he made no mistakes and yes, I suppose— deep 
sigh —he is probably the best driver in the world. Fine. There. Are you happy now?”

Why yes, Jenson. We are. Terribly happy, in fact. Because unlike you and your merry band of emotionally incontinent Union Jack-caped 
apologists, some of us are here to watch racing, not lick the metaphorical boots of anyone with a British passport and a sponsor-friendly 
smile.

The irony, of course, is that Max Verstappen, in driving, composure, and performance, embodies the very virtues these commentators claim to 
adore. Grit. Precision. Ruthlessness. Yet because he does not genuflect at the altar of their preferred narrative — because he refuses to 
be domesticated by their PR machinery — they treat him like a necessary evil, an uninvited guest who keeps winning all the family Monopoly 
games.

In truth, they do not hate Verstappen. They resent him. Because he renders their bias transparent. Because he dares to dominate on merit 
— and not in the name of Britain.

So, Sky Sports, if you’re reading this from your carbon-neutral, soundproofed sarcasm chamber: the jig is up. The audience is not blind, 
nor is it as pliable as you imagine. Your adoration of mediocrity draped in a Union Jack is embarrassing, your grudging respect for brilliance 
unbecoming, and your “neutrality” about as believable as a Ferrari pit strategy.

In conclusion: praise who deserves praise. Criticise who deserves criticism. And for the love of all that is petrol-soaked and glorious 
— stop pretending your commentary isn’t the audio equivalent of waving a British passport at a Dutch passport and calling it a “balanced 
perspective.”
