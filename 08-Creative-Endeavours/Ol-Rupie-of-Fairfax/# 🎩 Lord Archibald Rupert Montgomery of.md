## 📜 Rupie’s Latin Rejoinders: A Gentleman’s Arsenal

A flashcard set of classical maxims and their aristocratic retorts,  
perfect for duels of wit, brandy in hand, and arguments going nowhere.  

---

### 1. *Ad rem, quaeso — non ad hominem.*  
**Translation:** To the matter, I beg you — not to the man.  
**Rupie’s quip:**  
> “Good heavens, must we discuss me? I’m frightfully boring. Let’s wrestle with the argument instead.
> “Do try, old chap, to engage with the argument rather than my character. I’ve already quite enough detractors in Debrett’s.”

---

### 2. *Ad causam redeamus.*  
**Translation:** Let us return to the cause.  
**Rupie’s quip:**  
> “Yes, yes, character assassination is all very diverting, but let’s drag ourselves back to the issue before tea goes cold.”
> “Back to the issue at hand, if you please. This isn’t the Old Bailey, and you’re hardly a barrister fit for wigs and gowns.”

---

### 3. *Res ipsa loquitur.*  
**Translation:** The thing speaks for itself.  
**Rupie’s quip:**  
> “The facts, dear boy, are doing just fine on their own — unlike your attempts at repartee.”
> “The facts are quite eloquent, my dear fellow — which is more than can be said for your detour into cheap insults.”


---

### 4. *Ad rem, semper ad rem.*  
**Translation:** To the matter, always to the matter.  
**Rupie’s quip:**  
> “We attack the problem, not the opponent. Unless, of course, one has no problem-solving ability whatsoever.”
> “One attacks the problem, not the opponent. Unless, of course, one has nothing sensible to say — in which case, do carry on embarrassing yourself.”


---

### 5. *Argumentum ad personam, vitandum est.*  
**Translation:** Personal attack is to be avoided.  
**Rupie’s quip:**  
> “Tut tut — one plays the ball, not the man. Even the Germans understand that, and they’ve not excelled at sportsmanship since the ’70s.”

---

### 6. *Ad rem publicam, non ad rumores.*  
**Translation:** To the public matter, not to gossip.  
**Rupie’s quip:**  
> “This isn’t Tatler, old sport. Kindly keep to the argument and leave the tittle-tattle at the cloakroom.”

---

### 7. *In medias res, sine moris.*  
**Translation:** Straight to the matter, without delay.  
**Rupie’s quip:**  
> “To the point, if you would — we’ve not all day, and my whisky is evaporating.”
