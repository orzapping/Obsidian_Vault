Outstanding — a certified classic indeed. For what is Lord Archibald Rupert Montgomery of Fairfax if not the walking embodiment of weaponised likability? A man so devastatingly charming he once left an entire ethics committee unsure whether they’d been insulted or knighted.

And so, with the full authority of the Fairfax Institute of Behavioural Decorum & Subtle Violence, I present:

Rupie’s Rules for Weaponised Likability

Tactical Annex – Volume IV, Chapter III

Filed under: Emotional Camouflage, Social Engineering, and Disarmament via Compliment

⸻

🎩 Rule I: Charm is a Weapon, Not a Mood

“You are not here to make friends.
You are here to make people want to be your friend — while you rearrange the battlefield behind their backs.”

True likability is not rooted in sincerity. It is rooted in believability. You don’t need to be warm — you must appear warm enough to lower their defences.

⸻

🍷 Rule II: Always Offer Something First — Praise, Memory, Wine

“People are less inclined to notice you’re robbing them emotionally if you hand them a glass first.”

Begin with generosity. Flattery, recollection, or a gift of trivial value. The initial gesture buys psychological credit — which you may later spend on subterfuge.

⸻

🥂 Rule III: Compliment the Unexpected

“Never praise what they already know they’re good at — that’s for amateurs.”

Instead, praise:
	•	Their handwriting
	•	Their restraint in meetings
	•	Their punctuality during periods of national unrest
	•	Their choice of spouse (“remarkably tolerant woman”)
	•	Their child’s artwork (“shows signs of inner conflict… wonderful tension”)

This creates dissonance and curiosity — the perfect foundation for deeper manipulation.

⸻

🧠 Rule IV: Use Self-Deprecation as a Decoy

“Downplay yourself only to distract. Then strike while they’re clapping.”

The illusion of vulnerability makes the attack feel impossible.
e.g.

“Oh, I’d never survive in your industry — I can barely keep a spreadsheet balanced.
But I did glance at the P&L while waiting… fascinating reading, especially Q2.”

Result: They laugh, you smile, and the point lands quietly in the spleen.

⸻

🎭 Rule V: Be Memorable Without Being Traceable

“If they remember how likable you were, but can’t recall what you actually said, you’ve done your job.”

Speak warmly. Use evocative language. Give nothing away.
They will leave the conversation admiring your presence while forgetting you led them to agree to something deeply ill-advised.

⸻

🕰️ Rule VI: Smile First, Correct Second

“Always smile while dismantling their position. It confuses the nervous system.”

Example:

“What a brilliant idea — we simply don’t have the budget, the time, or the legal clearance. But God, I wish we did.”

This preserves likability while still annihilating their suggestion.

⸻

📜 Rule VII: Use Names — But Sparingly

“Too much and you sound like a used car salesman. Too little and you sound like a war criminal.”

The ideal ratio is once at greeting, once at pivot, once at farewell.

⸻

🔍 Rule VIII: Always Depart First

“Control your exit like a military withdrawal — gracious, quick, and leaving nothing behind but confusion.”

Leaving first maintains power, ensures the final impression is yours, and prevents the conversation from wandering into uncontrolled terrain.
Never overstay. Charm fades after the second drink or the third anecdote.

⸻

🪞 Final Rule: Believe Nothing, Mean Less, Deliver Everything With Sincerity

“The great lie of weaponised likability is that you care.
You don’t. But they must believe you do — for just long enough to do as they’re told.”

This is not dishonesty.
This is behavioural diplomacy — and in the right hands, it can convince a man to sign away half his fortune while thanking you for the stationery.
