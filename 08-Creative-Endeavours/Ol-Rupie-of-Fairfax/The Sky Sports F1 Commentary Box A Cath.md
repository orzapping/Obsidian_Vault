The Sky Sports F1 Commentary Box: A Cathedral of Hypocrisy in Full High-Definition

There are few spectacles in modern broadcasting quite so exquisitely British as the Sky Sports F1 team attempting, with the solemnity of a funeral director praising the deceased, 
to convince the viewing public that they are neutral. One almost expects them to cross their hearts and hope to die while the Union Jack flutters invisibly behind their eyes.

Let us examine today’s Las Vegas Grand Prix sprint, a neon-drenched fifty laps of honest motor racing, and yet a doctoral thesis in selective vision. Lando Norris—national treasure, 
fresh-faced hope of the Home Counties—starts on pole. Max Verstappen, the Dutchman who has spent the last four seasons treating the championship like his personal fiefdom, 
lines up alongside. Lights out. Into Turn 1, Norris lunges down the inside with all the precision of a man trying to parallel-park a superyacht. He locks up, sails wide, gifts the 
lead to Verstappen and, for good measure, drops behind George Russell as well. A manoeuvre so catastrophically botched that even the most devoted McLaren strategist would have required 
a stiff drink.

And what, pray tell, was the immediate verdict from the commentary box? Mr Jenson Button—2009 world champion, noted wearer of pastel shirts—cooed, live and unfiltered, that it was
 “appropriately aggressive” and “a great move from Lando.” One imagines the words were accompanied by a gentle pat on an imaginary golden retriever. Not a syllable, not a breath, 
 not even the vaguest allusion to the fact that Norris had just transformed pole position into third faster than one can say “overambitious dive-bomb.” No, no—best not to mention that. 
 Mummy might be watching.

This, dear reader, is not bias. This is glazing of such industrial thickness that it could be used to varnish the hull of HMS Victory. It is the commentary equivalent of a mother insisting
 her son’s finger-painting is worthy of the National Gallery while the rest of us stare at a stick man with three heads.

And then there is the Verstappen Problem. Poor Max. Every victory must be acknowledged through gritted porcelain teeth, as though praising him causes actual physical pain. 
“Yes, well, he’s done it again, hasn’t he?” one hears, in a tone normally reserved for discovering the dog has shat on the Persian rug once more. When Verstappen wins cleanly, 
the praise arrives late, begrudging, and wrapped in so many qualifiers it sounds like a hostage video: “Obviously Max is very quick… when the car’s working… which it is today… 
annoyingly.” When he makes a mistake, however, the glee is palpable, the schadenfreude practically dripping from the gantry like warm toffee.

The pièce de résistance, of course, is the wounded indignation when anyone dares point this out. “British bias? Us? Perish the thought!” they cry, clutching their pearls with the same hand
 that was, moments earlier, vigorously polishing the halo of whichever driver went to the correct public school. The denial is delivered with such theatrical sincerity that one 
 half-expects Sir David Attenborough to narrate: “Here we see the Sky pundit in its natural habitat, performing the ancient ritual of pretending it has no national preference while 
 simultaneously fellating the Union Jack.

”Let us be clear: every nation’s broadcast has its leanings. The Dutch wax lyrical about Max with the fervour of tulip farmers in spring. The Italians treat Ferrari like a religion 
that accepts only suffering as tithe. The Spanish still speak of Alonso as though he is about to part the Red Sea. That is honest tribalism—transparent, almost endearing. What Sky 
offers is something far more insidious: the pretence of impartiality while engaging in the most shameless homeland favouritism since the BBC covered the 2012 Olympics.

The tragedy is that the commentary team contains genuinely knowledgeable people who, were they allowed to drop the act, could be excellent. Instead, they are shackled to a script that 
demands they treat every British driver as a plucky underdog even when he is leading the championship, and every foreign rival as a temporary inconvenience to be tolerated until the 
natural order reasserts itself.

So, gentlemen of the Sky gantry—Messrs Croft, Button, Brundle (when he can be dragged away from grid-walk celebrity spotting), and the rest—allow me to offer a modest proposal. 
Either embrace your bias with the honesty of a drunk uncle at a wedding, or attempt actual neutrality. But please, for the love of all that is holy, spare us the pious charade. 
Your blushing denials only make the favouritism more obvious, and the glaze upon young Lando’s posterior is now so thick that light itself cannot escape it.

The British public is not, contrary to popular belief in Woking, composed entirely of flag-waving simpletons. We can cope with patriotism. What we cannot abide is being taken for bloody
 fools.Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to watch the race again—on F1TV, with the international feed. At least there they call a botched lunge a botched lunge, rather than 
 “appropriately aggressive.”
