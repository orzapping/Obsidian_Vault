Regulation and the Ghost of Dylan: A Financial Horror in Beige

There it was.

Hanging silently, ominously, absurdly — on the wall of 25 The North Colonnade, in the grand lobby of the UK’s Financial Services Authority — a giant piece of off-white canvas with strange cutouts.

Not a painting. Not a slogan. Not a mission statement. Just a cryptic slab of beige cloth with letters carved out, revealing the wall behind like some bureaucratic Stonehenge.

At first glance, you’d think it was some abstract art piece. Perhaps a poetic quote on integrity or risk awareness. Maybe the Magna Carta in Helvetica.

But no.

It was the lyrics to Positively 4th Street.

Yes. Bob Dylan. That Bob Dylan.

You’ve got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend…

The first line hit like a punch in the ribs. The rest followed, carved line by line into silence, staring every visitor directly in the soul as they waited for their compliance meeting, enforcement hearing, or polite regulatory flogging.

And make no mistake — this wasn’t a small nod to Dylan, nor a cherry-picked phrase. It was the entire song. No attribution, no punctuation, no chorus breaks. Just a relentless block of carved lyrics spanning what must have been two metres across and nearly three metres high.

Cold. Stark. Colourless.

The words were spaced just enough to register as separate — if you paid close attention. But to the untrained eye, it looked like an unbroken spell of spite carved into canvas.

It was not interpretive.

It was intentional.

A silent sermon delivered through absence — letters revealed not by ink or pigment, but by what had been cut away.

And no one said a word.

Not the security guards. Not the receptionists. Not the junior compliance analysts marching past in silent dread. Not even the senior directors — who must have passed it hundreds of times, perhaps even commissioned it. Nothing. Absolute institutional silence.

Except for one man.

A Dylan fan. A financial professional. A man who knew the lyrics not just as poetry, but as fire — and recognised them instantly as something utterly out of place.

Why was that song, of all songs, hanging in the lobby of the UK’s top financial regulator?

Why those lyrics?

“When I was down you just stood there grinning…”

Was it a secret confession? A veiled threat? A passive-aggressive nod to the firms under scrutiny? Or, more unsettlingly, a subconscious self-own by the very people meant to guard the gates?

You see, this wasn’t just any Dylan tune. Positively 4th Street is not whimsical. It’s a lyrical blade. A slow dissection of betrayal, hypocrisy, and performative friendship.

“I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes / And just for that one moment I could be you…”

The implications were… staggering.

This wasn’t culture. This was theatre. This was institutional-grade psychological warfare.

And yet, no one would talk about it. Even over drinks at Browns — that venerable haunt of BarCap lads and Canary Wharf exiles — not a whisper. Not a wink. Not even a raised eyebrow.

It was Orwellian.

It was insane.

It was… utterly real.

Years later, the FSA is no more. Its name dissolved in the acid of public scrutiny and regulatory rebooting. But the ghost of that canvas still hangs in memory.

Regulation is many things. But it is rarely poetic.

Except, perhaps, when it’s accidentally quoting Dylan while staring you in the face.

“Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes…”

“…You’d know what a drag it is to see you.”

And with that line, ladies and gentlemen, one begins to wonder:

Who was the message really for?

And did they ever read it?

Appendix: Public Reference

Footnote [1]: According to a now-archived blip from Financial News London, the mural displayed the Dylan lyric: “You say, ‘How are you?’ / Good luck!” — a curt, searing slice of lyrical venom selected, one assumes, with either chilling irony or absolute obliviousness. Interpretations vary. Sanity not guaranteed.

A towering, unbroken wall of Bob Dylan’s disdain, cut with surgical precision into beige canvas… and into the psyche of anyone paying attention.
