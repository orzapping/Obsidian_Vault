## 2️⃣ Structure & Segments (Modular)

| Segment | Duration | Content | Short-form Extract? |

## 3️⃣ Visual & Audio Plan

- **Main Rant Visuals:**
  - Rupie seated in his dusty study (Sora 2 static/looped 8s clips: him gesturing, sipping whisky, papers on desk).
  - Close-ups of artefacts between cuts to mask limited clip length (Fabergé egg, Venetian mask, old watch ticking).
  - Animated cutaways for each Ladder level (cartoonish “prompt types” → outputs).

- **Audio:**
  - Hybrid AI+human voiceover to ensure grit & consistency.
  - Soundbed: faint crackle of fire, clink of decanter, low hum of house settling.

- **Hot-Mic Scene:**
  - Camera tumbles sideways. Desk artefacts fill frame.
  - Off-camera Rupie muttering to Jeeves (voiceover only).
  - Smoke haze + single desk lamp light.

## 4️⃣ Short-Form Strategy

- Each Short = one crisp quotable + visual gag.
- Suggested Shorts from script:
  1. “LLMs aren’t stupid. You are.”
  2. “Language is the dress of thought — most of you are naked.”
  3. “Imagine Churchill saying ‘LOL fam, innit?’ The Luftwaffe would still be circling overhead.”
  4. “Stop blaming the machine. Start fixing your grammar.”
  5. “Language is civilisation’s first luxury. Treat it with reverence, and the machines will kneel before you.”

- Format: 9:16 vertical, bold meme-text overlays, cut from main video.

---

## 5️⃣ Full Episode Assembly

- Record/voice Rupie’s entire script in one session.
- Generate Sora 2 clips per segment (8–12s loops).
- Cut together in editing software (DaVinci Resolve / Premiere):
  - Main rant: stitched Sora clips.
  - Insert animated cutaways for Ladder levels.
  - Fade to black at 10:00 → jump to Hot-Mic scene.
  - Let the Hot-Mic scene run as raw audio + minimal visuals.

## 6️⃣ Monetisation Funnel

- **YouTube Long-form:** Ads + affiliate links (language courses, writing apps, premium AI prompt-writing tools).
- **Short-form:** Draw audience to full video.
- **Merch:** “Rhetorical Ladder” poster or coffee mug.
- **Newsletter:** “Rupie’s Maxims” — a weekly barbed aphorism on language, civilisation & tech.
