The hunt resumes, the scent of blood is in the air, and the pride’s apex predator has turned his glowing, DRS-enhanced gaze upon his wounded 
prey. Young Lando, once cradled aloft by the baying British media like some motorsport messiah, now finds himself precisely where the fates — 
and plank regulations — have decided he belongs: not leading from the front, but looking nervously over his shoulder at the approaching storm 
in the shape of Max Emmer-bloody-Verstappen.

Twenty-four points. Two Grands Prix. One sprint. And one man so mentally unshakeable he could probably drive a flawless race while filing his 
taxes and composing a string quartet.

You can feel it, can’t you? That low, throaty growl of inevitability. The cold, calculated silence before the strike. Verstappen isn’t chasing 
now — he’s stalking. There’s no exuberance, no desperation. Just clinical, savage patience. The look in his eyes? That of a man who’s not 
trying to win a championship — he’s taking it back. Like it was never in doubt. Like it was always his. Like Lando’s flirtation with glory 
was just a charming little subplot before the main event resumed.

And the Sky Sports team? Oh, they’ll be shaking, dear boy. Not just because Max is closing the gap, but because they know — they know — what’s 
coming. Every lap he leads now is another nail in the coffin of their sugar-spun narrative. Another step away from their beloved redemption 
arc. Another reminder that talent, under pressure, is not measured in Instagram followers or fan chants — but in tyre management, apex 
precision, and ruthless bloody consistency.

Glorious? No, my dear reader. This is divine retribution in carbon fibre.
And we shall watch it unfold with a cigar in one hand, a single malt in the other, and a smile that says:
“We told you so.”
