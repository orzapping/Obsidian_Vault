✅ **ACCEPTABLE** - Valid Russian Federation passport with appropriate validity period
- Document appears genuine based on visual inspection
- Issued during period of heightened geopolitical tensions (March 2022)
- Standard 10-year validity period

**Regulatory Considerations:**
- Russian nationals require Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) given current sanctions environment
- Passport issued post-February 2024 Ukraine conflict commencement
- Enhanced sanctions screening mandatory

### 2.2 Secondary Identity Document - UAE Emirates ID

**Document Details:**
- **ID Number:** 784-1956-1840874-4
- **Card Number:** 133514721
- **Issue Date:** 05 December 2023
- **Expiry Date:** 04 December 2033
- **Card Type:** Golden Card (10-year validity)
- **Stated Occupation:** Property Owner
- **Issuing Place:** Dubai

**Assessment:**
✅ **ACCEPTABLE** - Valid Emirates ID with extended validity

- Biometric chip present (2306002422)
- Consistent with stated occupation as "Property Owner"

**Notable Points:**

- **UID Number:** 230526802
- **File Number:** 201/2023/7701190
- **Passport Number:** 766946088 (matches Russian passport)

**Assessment:**
⚠️ **REQUIRES CLARIFICATION** - Date inconsistency noted
- **CRITICAL ISSUE:** The expiry date (2023/12/05) appears to predate the issue date (2033/12/04)
- This is likely a transcription/scanning error, but requires verification
- If visa expired in December 2023, client's current UAE residency status is questionable
- **Action Required:** Obtain clarification on actual visa validity dates

**Implication:**
- Cannot confirm current UAE residency status without clarified dates
- Material to address verification requirements under MLR 2017

---

## 3. Address Verification

### 3.1 Utility Bill - DEWA (Dubai Electricity & Water Authority)

**Document Details:**
- **Account Number:** 2046984501
- **Account Holder:** Alexander Chugunov
- **Property Address:** Flat 3-109, 332-Jumeira First, Dubai, UAE
- **Premise Number:** 332066037
- **Premise Type:** Residential - Flat
- **Invoice Date:** 12 August 2025
- **Billing Period:** 06 July 2025 to 05 August 2025
- **Account Type:** Residential
- **Business Partner ID:** 12031650

**Consumption Analysis:**
- **Electricity:** 100 kWh (very low consumption)
- **Water:** 2.273 m³ (approximately 500 imperial gallons)
- **Carbon Footprint:** 40 kg CO2e (exceptionally low - in "green" category)
- **Total Bill:** AED 411.55 (current), Credit balance: AED 585.16 CR

**Assessment:**
✅ **ACCEPTABLE** - Valid current utility bill meeting MLR 2017 address verification requirements
- Document is less than 3 months old (dated August 2025)
- Clearly shows client name and residential address
- Official document from legitimate utility provider (DEWA)

**Analytical Observations:**
⚠️ **LOW CONSUMPTION FLAGS:**
- Electricity consumption (100 kWh/month) is extremely low for a residential property
- Water usage similarly minimal
- Consumption pattern suggests:
  - Property may not be primary residence
  - Property may be vacant most of the time
  - Client may spend limited time in Dubai residence
  - Possible investment property rather than permanent residence

**Regulatory Implication:**
- If Dubai is not primary residence, this raises questions about:
  - Declared country of residence
  - Tax residency
  - Beneficial ownership structures
  - True residential status

**Action Required:** Clarify primary residence location and time spent in various jurisdictions

## 5. Source of Wealth / Source of Funds Analysis

### 5.1 Documentation Review

**Document Provided:** SOW_history.docx

**Assessment:**
❌ **UNABLE TO REVIEW - FILE NOT ACCESSIBLE**

The Source of Wealth history document could not be accessed for review. This is a **material deficiency** in the due diligence process.

### 5.2 Inferred Wealth Indicators

Based on available documentation, the following can be inferred:

**Property Ownership in UAE:**
- Golden Card/10-year residence visa indicates significant UAE investment
- Typical threshold: AED 2,000,000+ real estate investment or similar economic contribution
- Listed occupation: "Property Owner" on both Emirates ID and visa
- Self-sponsored status confirms financial independence

**Residential Property:**
- Occupies Flat 3-109 at Jumeira First (332-JUMEIRA FIRST)
- Jumeira is an affluent Dubai neighbourhood
- Property appears to be owned or long-term leased (utility account in client's name)

**Estimated Minimum Wealth:**
- UAE property investment: AED 2,000,000+ (approx. £430,000+)
- Additional assets unknown pending SOW documentation

**Red Flags / Areas of Concern:**

1. **Russian National with Significant UAE Assets (March 2022 Passport Issuance)**
   - Passport issued shortly after Western sanctions imposed
   - Raises questions about asset relocation/structuring timing
   - Enhanced scrutiny required on fund flows into UAE post-sanctions

2. **Property Owner as Sole Occupation at Age 69**
   - No indication of previous career/business activities
   - Source of wealth to acquire properties unclear
   - Retirement income sources not documented

3. **Moscow Birth / USSR Origin**
   - Generation that experienced Soviet collapse and 1990s privatisation
   - Potential exposure to Russian oligarch networks (regardless of client's involvement)
   - Enhanced due diligence protocols essential

**Mandatory Requirements:**

The firm **MUST** obtain and verify:

- Evidence of legitimate accumulation of capital
- Bank statements/financial records for material transactions
- Details of all property holdings and acquisition funding
- Explanation of business interests/previous employment
- Tax residency documentation and tax compliance history
- Details of any connections to politically exposed persons

**Enhanced Due Diligence Triggers:**
- ✅ Russian national (sanctions jurisdiction)
- ✅ High-value UAE property investor (threshold: >£250,000)
- ✅ Unclear wealth accumulation history
- ✅ Age profile consistent with 1990s Russian privatisation beneficiaries
- ✅ Self-employed/business owner category

**MLR 2017 Reg 33 Compliance:**
The firm must establish and verify:
1. Source of the funds used to acquire properties
2. Source of ongoing wealth sustaining lifestyle
3. Legitimacy of business activities (if any)
4. Connection (if any) to sanctioned entities/persons

## 14. Recommended Onboarding Decision

### 14.1 Current Status Decision

**RECOMMENDATION:** ❌ **ONBOARDING SUSPENDED PENDING REMEDIATION**

1. Complying with MLR 2017 CDD requirements
2. Meeting FCA conduct of business obligations
3. Assessing and managing ML/TF risk appropriately
4. Satisfying senior management that adequate due diligence has been conducted

**Regulatory Risk:**
Proceeding with onboarding in current state would expose the firm to:
- Regulatory enforcement action (FCA/OFSI)
- Financial penalties under MLR 2017
- Reputational damage
- Potential criminal liability for ML offences (if funds later proven illicit)
- Firm authorisation implications

### 14.2 Pathway to Approval

**1. Re-assess Risk Rating**
   - Conduct fresh risk assessment with complete information
   - If risk remains HIGH, confirm enhanced monitoring sustainable

**2. Senior Management Approval**
   - MLRO sign-off required
   - Risk Committee/Board approval for high-risk client
   - Document rationale for acceptance

**3. Determine Ongoing Monitoring Approach**
   - Enhanced transaction monitoring rules
   - Quarterly reviews scheduled
   - Monthly sanctions screening
   - Trigger events defined

**4. Proceed with Onboarding**
   - Account opening
   - Service provision commences
   - Enhanced monitoring activated

**Conditional Approval Possible If:**
- All critical items (1-7) completed
- EDD items (8-12) substantially progressed with clear completion timeline
- Client commits to providing outstanding items within 30 days
- Account remains unfunded/inactive until full EDD completed
- Senior management comfortable with conditional approach

---

## 15. Additional Observations & Recommendations

### 15.1 Red Flags Requiring Explanation

The following observations raise questions that require satisfactory answers:

1. **Passport Timing (March 2022)**
   - Passport issued within weeks of Ukraine conflict and Western sanctions
   - Warrants inquiry: Was this routine renewal or triggered by geopolitical events?
   - Relevant to understanding wealth management planning and asset movements

2. **Property Owner as Sole Occupation at 69**
   - No indication of previous career generating wealth
   - How was sufficient capital accumulated to invest AED 2M+ in UAE property?
   - Retirement income sources unclear

3. **Golden Card Status**
   - Indicates substantial UAE investment/economic contribution
   - Typical routes: Property investment AED 2M+, Business investment, or Special categories
   - Should be documented in SOW

4. **Low Dubai Residence Utilisation**
   - Utility consumption suggests property not primary residence
   - Where does client actually reside most of the time?
   - Tax implications for multiple residency

5. **Russian National in UAE Post-Sanctions**
   - UAE has become destination for Russian HNW individuals post-sanctions
   - While not inherently improper, requires enhanced scrutiny
   - Must ensure no sanctions evasion or structured asset protection

### 15.2 Process Improvement Recommendations

This onboarding file reveals potential process weaknesses:

**1. Incomplete File Submission**
   - **Issue:** Blank application form submitted
   - **Recommendation:** Implement file completeness checklist before compliance review
   - **Owner:** RM/Onboarding team

**2. Document Accessibility**
   - **Issue:** SOW document not accessible to reviewers
   - **Recommendation:** Standardise file formats and storage for compliance access
   - **Owner:** Operations/IT

**3. Pre-Screening Before Full KYC**
   - **Issue:** Significant effort expended before identifying critical gaps
   - **Recommendation:** Preliminary screening of sanctions/PEP before full onboarding
   - **Owner:** Compliance

**4. EDD Triggering**
   - **Issue:** Russian national should trigger automatic EDD procedures
   - **Recommendation:** Systematic EDD triggers in onboarding workflow
   - **Owner:** Compliance/IT

**5. RM Training**
   - **Issue:** File submitted without basic CDD completion
   - **Recommendation:** Enhanced training for RMs on regulatory requirements
   - **Owner:** HR/Compliance

### 15.3 Documentation Standards

For future files, ensure:
- All application forms fully completed before submission
- All supporting documents legible and properly dated
- File submitted in compliance-accessible formats
- Cover sheet summarising risk factors and proposed risk rating
- Preliminary sanctions/PEP screening completed
- Clear indication if EDD applies

## 17. Conclusion

### Summary Position

Alexander Chugunov presents as a **HIGH RISK** prospective client requiring Enhanced Due Diligence under MLR 2017. While the identity and address verification documents provided are satisfactory, **material deficiencies** in the onboarding file prevent the firm from:

1. Meeting MLR 2017 Customer Due Diligence requirements
2. Conducting adequate sanctions and PEP screening
3. Verifying source of wealth and funds
4. Assessing investment appropriateness/suitability
5. Determining tax reporting obligations
6. Understanding beneficial ownership structures

### Regulatory Position

**The firm CANNOT proceed with onboarding until all critical deficiencies are remediated.**

Proceeding in the current state would constitute:
- Breach of MLR 2017 (potential financial penalties)
- FCA authorisation implications
- Money laundering offence exposure
- Sanctions violation risk (if screening inadequate)
- Professional negligence

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Return file to Relationship Manager with remediation requirements
2. **Within 5 Days:** Client to provide corrected/completed documentation
3. **Within 10 Days:** Compliance to complete sanctions/PEP screening on full information
4. **Within 15 Days:** Re-submission of complete file for fresh compliance review
5. **Subject to Approval:** Senior management sign-off for high-risk client acceptance

### Final Observation

The client may well be entirely legitimate with a proper source of wealth and no adverse connections. However, **the regulatory principle is clear: adequate due diligence first, business relationship second.** 

The firm's reputation and regulatory standing depends on thorough, compliant onboarding procedures—particularly for high-risk jurisdictions and client categories.

We simply cannot make a "yes" determination without the basic building blocks of CDD being in place.
