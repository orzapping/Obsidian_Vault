## 0) Executive Summary

**Overall Status:** **⚠️ ON HOLD — Remediation Required (EDD client)**

Identity and address evidence appear valid (RF passport; UAE Emirates ID; recent DEWA utility bill). A UAE residence visa image presents **date anomalies** requiring clarification. The application form **is populated** (including income, assets and declarations), but we still require documentary corroboration for **Source of Wealth (SoW)** and to complete **Sanctions/PEP screening, CRS/FATCA self-certifications**, and final client classification and suitability/appropriateness steps.

**Provisional Risk Rating:** **HIGH** (Nationality/sanctions exposure; UAE residency; property‑led wealth; cross‑border profile).  
**Onboarding Decision:** **Suspend** pending remediation checklist in §12.

- **Education/Academic:** MSU Physics (MSc 1979; PhD 1985).  
- **Career:** MSU research/lecturer (1979–1995).  
- **Business:** **Sodis** (www.sodis.ru) — founding involvement; **17%** share since 1989; early reinvestment; **income since 2000 ~USD 300k p.a.**  
- **Assets declared:**  
  - **Cash/TDs:** USD **2.5m**  
  - **Investments:** USD **0.7m**  
  - **Real estate (USD ~7.93m):** Moscow apartment (acq. 2003 ~60k; now ~1m); Greece house (built 2006 ~500k; now ~5m); Moscow region country house (~500k; acq. 1996 ~20k); Moscow office space (acq. 2000–10 total ~800k; now ~1.43m; income **USD 90k p.a.**); **Dubai apartment** (acq. 2023 ~670k; now ~1m)  
  - **Business ownership:** USD **1.5m** (self‑valuation for 17%)  
  - **Liabilities:** **0**  
  - **Total wealth:** **USD 13.63m** (aligned with application)

### 5.2 Assessment & Evidence Required

- **Verification required (minimum):**  
  1) **Corporate:** Evidence of **17% shareholding** (register extract; notarised if RF; alternative OSINT/corporate registries), **historic dividends**, and valuation support for USD 1.5m.  
  2) **Banking flows:** **SoF** for Dubai 2023 acquisition (remitter details, swift/TTs, sale proceeds or dividends), and for Greek/Moscow properties (purchase contracts, notarisations, payment proofs).  
  3) **Property:** Title deeds/registry extracts (RF, Greece, UAE), and independent **valuations** (or conservative desk checks).  
  4) **Income:** Evidence supporting **USD 300k p.a.** post‑2000 (tax returns where feasible; accountant letter; audited extracts).  
  5) **Office rent income:** Statements/contracts corroborating **USD 90k p.a.**  
  6) **Tax:** CRS self‑certifications and any tax residency/treaty positions.

---

## 6) Sanctions & PEP Screening (To Be Completed)

- **Sanctions:** Full screening (UK HMT/OFSI consolidated; UN; EU; OFAC SDN/SSI; and reputable commercial tools) — include Cyrillic variants.  
- **PEP:** Database screening + completed declaration already states **Non‑PEP**; still require independent screening and false‑positive resolution.  
- **Intensified cadence post‑onboarding (if approved):** Monthly re‑screening.

---

## 7) Adverse Media / OSINT (To Be Completed)

- Multilingual searches (EN/RU/EL) for name variants, DOB, and corporate affiliations.  
- Court/bankruptcy/enforcement checks in RF, UAE, Greece.  
- Company‑level OSINT on **Sodis** (ownership, sector, counterparties, export controls exposure).  
- Preserve evidence (screenshots/links) and record dispositions.

---

## 8) Tax & Reporting

- **FATCA:** Client marked **Non‑US** — obtain **FATCA self‑certification**.  
- **CRS:** Determine **all** tax residencies; obtain **TINs** or reason codes. UAE residency alone may be insufficient if day‑counts or ties exist elsewhere (e.g., Russia/Greece/UK).  
- **Withholding/reporting:** Ensure internal client master is flagged for **CRS reporting** as appropriate.

---

## 9) Beneficial Ownership & Structure

- Client appears to act **for self** (no structures stated). Obtain a signed declaration that he is the **ultimate beneficial owner** (no nominees/trusts).  
- If the UAE property or other assets are held via SPVs, obtain **full ownership charts** and verify **25%+** beneficial owners and controllers.

---

## 10) Suitability / Appropriateness (FCA COBS)

- **Client categorisation:** Confirm **Retail/Professional/ECP** with rationale and notifications.  
- **Knowledge & experience:** Assess instruments requested.  
- **Objectives & horizon:** Income vs. growth; liquidity needs flagged as **“Important”** (per form) — reflect in portfolio construction.  
- **Risk tolerance/capacity:** Documented and consistent with strategy.  
- **Deliverables:** Suitability report (if advice/DM), risk warnings, fees disclosure, conflicts.

---

## 11) Risk Assessment (Provisional)

| Factor | Level | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Nationality / Sanctions Exposure | **High** | Russian national; requires EDD and strict sanctions controls. |
| Residency / Jurisdiction | **Medium** | UAE residency (FATF enhanced monitoring context). |
| Wealth Transparency | **Medium–High** | Coherent SoW but requires **documentary** corroboration; cross‑border property. |
| PEP Risk | **Medium** | Declaration non‑PEP; await database screening. |
| Transaction/SoF Risk | **Medium** | 2023 UAE acquisition; validate remitter source and channels. |
| Adverse Media | **Unknown** | To be completed. |
| Residency pattern | **Medium** | Low DEWA usage → likely non‑primary home; confirm tax nexus. |

**Overall Provisional Rating:** **HIGH**. Mandate **EDD**, **senior management/MLRO approval**, and **enhanced ongoing monitoring**.
