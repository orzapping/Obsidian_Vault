### 4.3 Sodis Travel Company - Independent Verification ✅

**Company Research Conducted:** 23 October 2025

**Company Profile:**
- **Name:** Sodis Travel Company (СОДИС)
- **Website:** www.sodis.ru
- **Founded:** 1989 ✅ (Exact match to SOW narrative)
- **Business Model:** VIP/luxury travel agency specialising in individual tourism
- **Target Market:** High-net-worth Russian clients, outbound travel to 80+ countries
- **Address:** 37 Vernadsky Avenue, Moscow, Russia, 117415

**Business Credentials:**
- ✅ IATA agent (International Air Transport Association accreditation)
- ✅ Winner: World Travel Market 1998 Global Award (prestigious international recognition)
- ✅ Winner: Moscow Business '98 competition
- ✅ Government of Moscow gold medal
- ✅ Network of ~500 travel agencies across Russia
- ✅ 35+ years continuous trading (1989-2025)

**Market Position:**
- Established, legitimate travel business
- Focus on high-margin VIP/luxury segment
- Long trading history demonstrates business viability
- Industry awards confirm market standing

**Historical Context - Perestroika Entrepreneurship:**

The founding of Sodis in 1989 by a Soviet physics academic is a **textbook example** of perestroika-era entrepreneurship:
- 1989: Gorbachev's economic reforms legalised private enterprise
- Soviet academics were among first to establish private businesses (educated, multilingual, international contacts)
- Travel agencies were particularly popular (low capital requirements, access to foreign currency, high margins)
- Physics academics often had foreign conference travel experience and language skills
- $300 initial investment is entirely plausible for Soviet academic's savings

**Income Viability Assessment:**

**Client Claims:**
- 17% ownership
- $200,000 annual dividend income
- Plus $90,000 office rental income

**Plausibility Analysis:**
- $200K dividend implies ~$1.18M total annual dividends paid (if all shareholders paid proportionally)
- Assuming 50-70% dividend payout ratio: Company profit $1.7M-$2.4M annually
- High-end travel agency with 500-agent network and VIP focus: Entirely plausible
- If processing $15M-$20M annual bookings at 10-12% margin = $1.8M-$2.4M revenue
- **Assessment:** ✅ Income claims are realistic for this business model and market position

### 4.4 Areas Requiring Further Verification 🔍

**Critical Outstanding Items:**

**1. Ownership Verification (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- **Required:** Shareholder register extract confirming 17% ownership
- **Required:** Company formation documents showing client as founder/shareholder
- **Rationale:** Essential for sanctions screening and beneficial ownership verification

**2. Shareholder Identification (HIGH PRIORITY - SANCTIONS/PEP)**
- **Required:** Identification of all other Sodis shareholders (83% ownership)
- **Rationale:** Must screen all shareholders for sanctions/PEP connections
- **Risk:** If any shareholder is sanctioned or PEP-connected, client relationship may be compromised

**3. Income Evidence (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- **Required:** Bank statements showing Sodis dividend payments to client
- **Period:** Last 12-24 months minimum
- **Rationale:** Evidence actual income matches stated income; verify payment routes
- **Sanctions consideration:** How are payments transferred from Russian company to UAE/international accounts?

**4. Recent Trading Performance (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
- **Question:** How has Sodis performed 2022-2025 given sanctions impact on Russian travel?
- **Context:** Russian travel industry severely impacted by:
  - COVID-19 (2020-2022)
  - Western sanctions (2022-present)
  - Flight restrictions
  - SWIFT payment system disruptions
- **Rationale:** Verify $200K annual income remains realistic in current environment

**5. Property Valuation - Greece (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
- **Client Claim:** $5M current value (built 2006 for $500K = 10x appreciation)
- **Concern:** Greece experienced severe economic crisis 2008-2018; property values declined significantly
- **Question:** What is basis for $5M valuation?
- **Required:** Independent property valuation or comparable sales evidence
- **Implication:** If overstated, client net worth is inflated

**6. Moscow Office Ownership Structure (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
- **Question:** Is office personally owned or business asset?
- **Income:** Client receives $90K p.a. "rental income"
- **Clarification needed:** Ownership structure and rental arrangement

**7. Tax Compliance (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
- **Russian Tax:** Russian nationals taxable on worldwide income
- **Required:** Evidence of Russian tax filings (if accessible)
- **UAE Tax:** UAE has no personal income tax, but CRS reporting applies
- **Required:** Formal CRS self-certification with Tax Identification Numbers

## 11. Specific Findings: Sodis Travel Company

### 11.1 Independent Business Verification Summary

**Company:** SODIS Travel Company (www.sodis.ru)

**Founded:** 1989 ✅ (Matches client narrative exactly)

**Business Model:** High-net-worth travel agency specialising in VIP individual tourism to 80+ countries

**Credentials Verified:**
- ✅ IATA accreditation (International Air Transport Association)
- ✅ World Travel Market 1998 Global Award
- ✅ Moscow Business '98 competition winner
- ✅ Government of Moscow gold medal
- ✅ Network of ~500 travel agencies across Russia
- ✅ 35+ years continuous operation (1989-2025)

**Historical Context:**
- Founding in 1989 during perestroika aligns perfectly with client's academic-to-entrepreneur narrative
- Soviet physicists establishing travel agencies was common (international contacts, language skills, low capital requirements)
- $300 initial investment is entirely realistic for Soviet academic's savings
- Business success trajectory matches Russia's economic development (difficult 1990s, growth 2000s, challenges 2020s)

**Income Viability:**
- Client claims $200K annual dividends from 17% stake
- High-end travel agency with VIP focus and 500-agent network can plausibly generate sufficient profit
- Estimated company profit $1.7M-$2.4M annually required to support claimed dividends
- For established agency processing $15M-$20M bookings at 10-12% margin: **Entirely realistic**

**Assessment:** ✅ **Business entity verified as legitimate, established, and capable of generating claimed income levels.**

### 11.2 Outstanding Business Verification Items

**1. Shareholder Register (CRITICAL)**
- Must identify all shareholders (currently know only that client owns 17%)
- Need names, ownership percentages for all shareholders
- **Purpose:** Sanctions/PEP screening of all shareholders mandatory
- **Risk:** If any shareholder sanctioned or PEP-connected, relationship may be compromised

**2. Financial Statements (DESIRABLE)**
- Recent company financial statements would verify income claims
- May not be accessible from Russian entity
- Client may not have access to detailed financials as minority shareholder

**3. 2022-2025 Trading Impact (IMPORTANT)**
- Russian travel industry severely affected by COVID and sanctions
- Western destinations limited, SWIFT payment disruptions
- Business likely shifted to non-sanctioned destinations (Turkey, UAE, Egypt, Asia)
- Question: Has dividend income remained $200K or has it declined?
- **Action:** Review bank statements to see actual recent payments

## 12. Greece Property Valuation Concern

### 12.1 Issue Identified

**Client Claim:**
- Greece house built 2006 for $500,000
- Current value stated as $5,000,000
- Appreciation: 10x over 18 years

**Concern:**
Greece experienced severe economic crisis 2008-2018:
- Property values declined significantly (often 30-50% falls)
- Recovery has been slow and uneven
- 10x appreciation during this period is highly unusual unless:
  - Premier location (Mykonos, Santorini, Athens prime areas)
  - Significant property improvements/development
  - Exceptional market circumstances

### 12.2 Implications

**If Valuation Overstated:**
- Client's stated net worth ($13.63M) would be inflated
- Real estate assets may be closer to $4M-$5M vs. $8.93M claimed
- Adjusted net worth might be $8M-$10M rather than $13.6M
- Still substantial wealth, but material difference

**Recommendation:**
- Request independent property valuation
- OR comparable sales evidence for similar properties in area
- OR accept client's valuation with caveat documented
- Not deal-breaker but should be clarified for accurate financial profiling

## 13. Tax Residency Considerations

### 13.1 Potential Multiple Tax Residency

**Possible Tax Residency Jurisdictions:**

**Russia:**
- Russian citizen
- Maintains properties in Moscow and Moscow region
- May spend significant time in Russia
- Russian nationals taxable on worldwide income (though tax treaties apply)

**UAE:**
- 10-year residence visa
- Registered address in Dubai
- However, low utility consumption suggests not primary residence
- UAE has no personal income tax (but CRS reporting applies)

**Greece:**
- Owns substantial property (allegedly $5M value)
- May spend time there (lifestyle property?)
- Greece taxes residents on worldwide income

**Assessment:**
Client likely has complex tax residency situation requiring:
- Formal CRS self-certification indicating ALL countries of tax residency
- Tax Identification Numbers for each jurisdiction
- Explanation of time spent in each location
- Tax advisor confirmation of compliance (desirable)

### 13.2 CRS Reporting Obligations

**Required:**
- CRS self-certification form completed
- All countries of tax residency declared
- TINs provided for each jurisdiction
- Reason stated if TIN not available

**Potential Complexity:**
- If tax resident in multiple jurisdictions, must report to all
- Client must determine primary tax residence for treaty purposes
- May require professional tax advice to confirm status

**Action:** Client to complete CRS self-certification with professional advice if needed

## 16. Conclusion

### 16.1 Overall Assessment

This client relationship has progressed significantly from initial assessment. The file now contains:

✅ **Complete customer due diligence documentation**
✅ **Verified identity and address**
✅ **Coherent, detailed Source of Wealth narrative**
✅ **Independent verification of stated business interests**
✅ **Plausible income and asset accumulation claims**
✅ **Internal consistency across all documentation**
✅ **No immediate red flags in available information**

However, **critical regulatory compliance steps remain outstanding**:

❌ **Sanctions screening** (mandatory before proceeding)
❌ **PEP screening** (mandatory before proceeding)
❌ **Income evidence** (bank statements required within 30 days)
❌ **Tax compliance forms** (FATCA/CRS self-certification)
❌ **Shareholder identification** (needed for sanctions/PEP screening)

### 16.2 Final Recommendation

**CONDITIONAL PROCEED WITH ACCOUNT OPENING**

**Subject to:**
1. Satisfactory sanctions screening outcomes
2. Satisfactory PEP screening outcomes  
3. MLRO sign-off
4. Senior management approval
5. Account remains unfunded until income evidence received  - Not applicable as orcap does not host funded client accounts.
6. Enhanced monitoring framework activated from day one

**Risk Rating:** 🔴 **HIGH RISK** (Russian national - mandatory Enhanced Due Diligence)

**Risk Trajectory:** ⬆️ **IMPROVING** (legitimate business background verified, coherent narrative, client cooperation)

**Regulatory Position:** The firm CAN proceed with this relationship provided all Enhanced Due Diligence requirements are satisfied and appropriate risk mitigation measures are implemented.

This is a materially different conclusion from the initial assessment ("STOP - Cannot Proceed"), reflecting the substantial improvements in documentation quality and verification of the client's stated background.

**However:** This remains a high-risk relationship requiring senior management oversight, enhanced monitoring, and strict adherence to EDD protocols throughout the relationship lifecycle.
