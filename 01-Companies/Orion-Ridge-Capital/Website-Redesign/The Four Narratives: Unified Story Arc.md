The Four Narratives: Unified Story Arc

Tool 1 (Risk Calculator): "Find your hidden vulnerabilities"
Tool 2 (Comparison Slider): "See the architecture advantage"
Tool 3 (Mobility Quiz): "Discover your optimal profile"
Tool 4 (Heat Map): "Hear the regulatory avalanche before it buries you"
Common Thread: Every narrative moves from invisible risk → visible architecture → actionable intelligence. The heat map narrative is the "time" dimension—regulatory risk is happening now, and you need real-time awareness.
Your messaging is now a complete ecosystem:
Space: Where is your wealth concentrated? (Calculator)
Structure: What should your architecture look like? (Quiz)
Time: What's happening right now that could change everything? (Heat Map)
Choice: Why is multi-jurisdictional better? (Slider)
All four tools, all four narratives, all four CTAs—ready for implementation.
