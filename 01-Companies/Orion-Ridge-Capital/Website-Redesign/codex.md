# Codex Mandate

## Branch
- `codex-website-version` (created from `gemini-branch`) dedicated to the ORCAP UI/UX redesign.

## Scope
- UI/UX only; no edits to copy or messaging. Preserve the three rotating hero silos and their CTAs exactly as written.
- Keep Why ORCAP, Services, and calculator narratives intact; adjust layout and styling only.
- Work inside `DEVELOPMENT/orcap-website_redesign/orcap_website`; avoid touching `GOLDEN-SOURCE`, `ARCHIVE`, or other sibling projects.

## Objectives
- Deliver a bespoke, high-trust UI for UHNW/HNW clients that foregrounds institutional freedom and jurisdictional sovereignty.
- Maintain CTA routing to the Risk Calculator, Architecture Comparison, and Mobility Quiz while refining their presentation.
- Ensure accessibility (contrast, focus states, reduced motion), responsive layouts, and strong performance.

## Success Criteria
- 100% copy fidelity; hero rotation/CTAs remain intact.
- Visual identity is distinct from Claude and Gemini while honoring the brand philosophy.
- Smooth, restrained motion with mobile parity.
- Clear contributor guidance (agents.md) and an executable design plan.

## Non-Goals
- Rewriting, shortening, or reordering any narrative or marketing copy.
- Back-end integrations beyond existing stubs.
- Adding new funnels or unscoped flows outside the documented experience.
