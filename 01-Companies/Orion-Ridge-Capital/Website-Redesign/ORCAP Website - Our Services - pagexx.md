gpt5.1 proposal:

Adrian, old boy — splendid timing.
Your current service descriptions are perfectly functional… but for an HNW audience, they’re too safe, too “industry standard,” too much like every other regulated firm whispering into the void.

Let’s elevate them to quiet power, architectural clarity, and sovereign positioning — drawing on the brand tone we’ve built elsewhere.

Below, I’ll give you:
	1.	A refined section heading + intro
	2.	New, polished versions of all four cards
	3.	Optional alternative tones (lean aristocratic, institutional, or understated-luxury)
	4.	(Optional) A variation for when Portfolio Management goes live

All text is designed to fit cleanly inside your 2×2 card layout.

I. Section Heading + Intro (Enhanced)

Our Services

Architecture, execution, and oversight — delivered independently.

We provide a tightly integrated set of services built for internationally minded families who expect sophistication, precision and discretion at every stage of their financial life.

(Note: this aligns the section with your “sovereign architecture” message without repeating the phrase too obviously.)

⸻

II. Refined 2×2 Service Cards (Best Version)

1. Investment Advisory

Strategic advice, independent by design.
We deliver clear, evidence-based recommendations tailored to your objectives, risk appetite and life trajectory — without product shelves, sales agendas or institutional blind spots.
You receive clarity, not complexity.

⸻

2. Portfolio Management (Coming soon)

Discretion with discipline and transparency.
Our discretionary offering combines rigorous oversight, multi-institutional flexibility and full reporting — so every decision is traceable, rational, and aligned with your long-term architecture.
We manage the detail; you retain the control.

⸻

3. Custodian Selection

The right partners across the right jurisdictions.
Global custody is fragmented, inconsistent and often misunderstood.
We analyse your needs, regulatory exposure and geographical footprint, then curate the banks and custodians that best fit your long-term architecture — not someone else’s sales priorities.

⸻

4. Administrative Services

Operational complexity handled with precision.
From onboarding, KYC and documentation to liaison with banks, partners and institutions, we manage the operational burden discreetly and efficiently.
You focus on decisions; we handle the machinery.

⸻

III. Optional Variants (Pick a tone)

A. More Aristocratic, Ol’ Rupie-Adjacent (but still professional)

(This gives the copy a faintly patrician, high-confidence undertone.)

Investment Advisory

Advice unpolluted by product bias or institutional whim.
Your objectives, unclouded; your decisions, empowered.

Portfolio Management

A discretionary service built for those who prefer elegance over noise.
We operate with transparency, discipline and unhurried precision.

Custodian Selection

A global network curated with taste, discernment and hard data — not incentives.
Your assets belong with institutions that merit the responsibility.

Administrative Services

The unglamorous engine room of wealth.
Handled flawlessly, invisibly, and without fuss.

⸻

B. More Institutional / Family Office Tone

(Feals neutral, authoritative, research-led.)

Investment Advisory

Data-driven frameworks, institutional-grade oversight, and independent recommendations aligned to your unique risk and return objectives.

Portfolio Management

A disciplined, research-led process combining tactical agility with long-term strategic allocation — delivered with full transparency.

Custodian Selection

Expert evaluation of global custodians across risk, jurisdictional resilience, service depth and regulatory alignment.

Administrative Services

Streamlined processes, compliant documentation workflows and coordinated execution across your banking and investment counterparties.

⸻

C. Understated Luxury / Ultra-Minimalist (like a high-end Swiss FO)

Investment Advisory

Insight. Clarity. Alignment — nothing more, nothing less.

Portfolio Management

Disciplined execution informed by experience and guided by your long-term design.

Custodian Selection

Selecting institutions that strengthen the architecture, not complicate it.

Administrative Services

Precision applied quietly. Efficiency without friction.

⸻

IV. Optional Alternative Section Titles

If you’d like to elevate the heading further:
	•	What We Do (And Why It Matters)
	•	Services Built Around Your Architecture
	•	Independent Expertise, Delivered With Precision
	•	Design. Execution. Stewardship.
	•	A Complete Architecture for Modern Wealth
	•	The Infrastructure Behind Your Decisions

⸻

V. My recommendation

For your brand tone (refined, sovereign, understated power), the “Best Version” above is the perfect fit — polished, modern, HNW-appropriate, and fully aligned with the sovereign architecture narrative.

If you’d like, I can now:
	•	Fit these into your exact 2×2 card structure,
	•	Provide line-length optimisations for visual rhythm,
	•	Generate a ClaudeCode implementation prompt just like last time,
	•	Or craft micro-heading alternatives for each card (single-word, two-word, etc.).

Just say the word, old boy.
