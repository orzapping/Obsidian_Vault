How It Works
User Journey:
Default State (50/50): Both models visible, neutral comparison
Slide Left (<50): Traditional model highlights, shows limitations
Slide Right (>50): Architecture model highlights, shows advantages
Extremes (<20 or >80): Final CTA appears with strong conversion push
Engagement Physics:
Left side highlights traditional model's problems (red ✗ icons)
Right side highlights architecture's solutions (gold ✓ icons)
Slider movement progressively reveals features— creates curiosity to keep sliding
Final CTA only appears at extremes (when user is convinced)
Key Features
1. Progressive Disclosure
Features highlight as slider moves past 60% in either direction
Creates "peel back the onion" effect—user wants to see what's next
2. Visual Weight Shifting
Opacity changes based on slider position
Active model becomes more prominent visually
3. Psychological Framing
Traditional side: Blue, negative icons (✗), problem-focused language
Architecture side: Gold, positive icons (✓), solution-focused language
4. Conversion Triggers
CTA appears only when user commits to an extreme (high engagement)
Secondary CTA always visible to keep user moving through funnel


// Automatic event tracking included
gtag('event', 'slider_engagement', {
    'slider_position': position, // 0-100
    'engagement_quality': 'high' // if >70 or <30
});

Track in your CRM:
High engagement (>70): Tag as "Architecture-Minded"
Traditional focus (<30): Tag as "Risk-Aware" (needs education)
Comparison mode (40-60): Tag as "Evaluating" (needs case studies)
