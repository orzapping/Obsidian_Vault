# Gemini vs Claude Readout (Codex Prep)

## Mandate (from client)
- UI/UX only; keep all existing copy and narratives verbatim, including the three rotating hero silos and their CTAs.
- Audience: UHNW/HNW, FCA-regulated advisor positioning; highlight institutional freedom, jurisdictional sovereignty, and generational liquidity.
- Goal: produce a Codex variant for leadership, separate from the Claude (main) and Gemini versions, with zero copy changes.

## Claude Experience (reference)
- Palette: ivory/linen/sand with sage/terracotta/taupe accents; Playfair + Inter; warm minimalism and restrained motion.
- Hero: 3 rotating silos every ~10s with mandated copy and CTAs mapped to Risk Calculator, Architecture Comparison, and Mobility Quiz; soft parallax/tints.
- Why ORCAP: rotating mantra lines independent of static evidence cards (2x2 grid).
- Services: 2x2 grid with refined long-form copy; tasteful “Coming Soon” for Portfolio Management.
- Tools: fullscreen modal suite with weighted scoring (risk, slider comparison, 8-question mobility quiz).
- Visual rhythm: progressive background darkening, lavish spacing, cinematic but light-touch motion.

## Gemini Experience (branch snapshot)
- Palette: void/alabaster/tungsten with gilded gold; grid lines + noise overlays; glassmorphic cards.
- Fonts: Cormorant Garamond (italic headlines) + Manrope (UI).
- Hero: “Sovereign Operating System” manifesto; static copy replaces rotating silos; orbiting gradient blobs; CTA copy diverges from mandated language.
- New Diagnostic Gateway hub launches calculators; calculators simplified to fewer questions and altered wording.
- Why/Services rewritten into vertical narrative stream and blueprint grid; some copy condensed or shifted.
- Overall: trading-terminal aesthetic, dark-mode heavy, assertive gradients and motion.

## Gaps to Close in Codex
- Restore verbatim messaging (hero silos + CTAs, Why ORCAP mantras/cards, services copy).
- Reconcile luxury tone with clarity—avoid over-ornamentation while keeping architectural gravitas.
- Align calculator UIs with the strategic copy while retaining sophistication and accessibility.
- Preserve reduced-motion behavior and mobile performance; current Gemini hero/gateway lean on heavier motion.

## Opportunity for Codex
- Blend Claude’s warm sovereignty palette with Gemini’s instrument-panel precision without losing the mandated language.
- Create a dual-depth experience: editorial, light-forward hero and darker instrument surfaces for tools.
- Use intentional typography and spatial rhythm to let long copy breathe while feeling bespoke and high-trust.
