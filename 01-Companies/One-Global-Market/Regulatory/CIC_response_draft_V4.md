DRAFT FCA RESPONSE ‚ OGM POSITION STATEMENT (Ref: CIC/211843243/HD)

To: Hannah Docherty

From: One Global Market Limited

Re: Response to Regulatory Concerns on Change in Control Notification

Date: [Insert Date]

Dear Ms Docherty,

Thank you for your letter dated 15 December 2025 regarding the proposed Change in Control Notification submitted in relation to One Global Market Limited.  OGM's management team remains committed to maintaining the highest standards of governance, regulatory engagement and compliance and remains focused on ensuring the firm conducts its affairs in a prudent, transparent and client-focused manner.

We have reviewed your concerns carefully, and we would like to take this opportunity to address a number of points raised in your earlier correspondence.  We write not only to address the points raised, but to clarify a number of critically important factors concerning the business, our intentions and the structure of the transaction and the CiC application. 

1.  On 'inactivity' and New Firm Authorisation
2. Continuity of business - the "dormant" mis-characterisation

**FCA premise:**  "the Target Firm has not been trading since September 2024...will need to re-establish itself from a dormant position."

**Statutory test:** FEES 4.2.1 R(2) - a firm is **dormant only if** it has **no regulated activities, no client money and no reporting obligations** for the **entire fee year**.

We acknowledge your observations and comments surrounding the firm 'inactivity' over the recent period.  However we must respectfully disagree that this position amounts to OGM effectively needing to (i) re-establish itself from a dormant position as a (ii) new business.  With the utmost respect this position does not give sufficient due regard or weight to the essential key factors that gave rise to those circumstances or the management decisions taken.

We would wish to clarify that the decision to pause trading was one taken with great care and deliberation, and one informed by clear intent and strategic objective.  As you know, the decision was precipitated by the firms former technology provider withdrawing from the market.  This incidentally coincided with the emergence of potential change in control negotiations at the time.

Accordingly, OGM's management team made several operational and strategic decisions that were principally driven by prudence, responsibility and client best-interests.  Whereas OGM could have elected to recommence trading at a much earlier stage following technology provider migration, it was further decided not to burden any clients with any uncertainty or volatility during the CiC process, but rather await completion before trading resumption.

We would further emphasise that all throughout this period, OGM remained fully authorised, fully capitalised and fully engaged in communication with its clients and counterparties.  At no stage of this process would it have been fair or reasonable to deem OGM either 'dormant' or 'inactive'.  To do so would have been a wholly unfair mis-characterisation of the firm, its people, situation and circumstance.  

Accordingly, we as the Management of OGM see this as prudent, responsible stewardship. 

The inference that this prudence now potentially constitutes grounds to reject the transaction‚ or rather to suggest that the firm must reapply for authorisation entirely, is to punish good governance in favour of appearances. We respectfully submit that this is not the outcome the FCA should wish to encourage, nor the precedent it should set.

We would further note and are pleased to confirm that the firm has now resumed trading operations, with client activity being now fully reactivated. All infrastructure is live, regulatory reporting systems are fully operational, and existing clients are returning under the supervision of the same compliance and executive team that has governed the firm for the past decade.

The decision to resume trading was taken not in defiance of this process, but to make it abundantly clear that OGM is fully operational.

2.  Change in Control route & FCA concerns

We understand the FCA's view that, in certain circumstances, the Change in Control process may not be the appropriate regulatory route where a transaction would result in what is effectively a new business.

We respectfully note the FCA's position in this regard may have been informed by the firms 'inactivity' during its technology migration period leading to the eventual Change in Control application.  We do wish to clarify however that OGM's intention in proceeding via the Change in Control route was informed by and predicated upon these principles: 

* continuity of management, 
* governance and 
* prudential integrity 

as the best and most appropriate mechanisms and procedure to bring about an equitable and just technological and ownership transition.

We continue to standby these principles and remain open to engaging constructively and effectively with the FCA on the most appropriate path forward and whilst giving careful consideration to the concerns and points raised by your office.

3.  OGM Governance and Management Commitment

The firms executive management team, all of whom are SMF holders, founded OGM from inception. We navigated its original FCA authorisation, oversaw its growth, weathered operational transitions, guided it through the pandemic (and its accompanying market turmoil), and have always managed to uphold its good name, reputation and regulatory standing for nearly ten years without material incident or breach.

This is not a job to us. It is not a board seat or a career milestone. It is a firm we built, shaped, and have committed our professional lives to. That commitment is not time-bound.

While the Share Purchase Agreement references a twelve-month minimum commitment for management continuity, this was never intended to reflect the limit or bounds of our involvement. It was a legal convention, not an expiry date. In reality, our intention is, and has always been, indefinite and reflects our long-standing, embedded relationship with the business.

We are therefore concerned that this clause has been taken as a sign of transactional brevity, rather than what it is: an expression of our long-term commitment to continue leading OGM in perpetuity. To question our continuity is to ignore the very substance and structure of the business and the people that have stood and fought behind it for nearly a decade now.

OGM is not a new firm.  Nor is it a dormant one, or one operated by transient managers seeking a quick exit. OGM is the culmination of nearly a decade of hard work, struggle, determination and hard wired commitment by the very individuals who built it.

4. Information disclosure deficiencies

Following receipt of your recent correspondence, we have reviewed and discussed the level of accuracy and completeness of information provided in the proposed controller forms.  We are of course dismayed by the missing information in the Section 178 notification forms and subsequent responses to the FCA.  During the completion of the forms, and while preparing the responses to your questions, we consistently emphasised to the proposed controllers and their representatives the importance of comprehensive transparency in all regulatory dealings.

It has become apparent that this issue arose due to the role played by the UK based director (and her administrative team) of Interstellar Markets Group Ltd, Heid Zhu, who was acting as the conduit for collecting all the required information, including in regard to their previous dealings with the FCA, as well as the proposed individual controller himself.

Following our careful review and analysis, we do not believe that her actions were intended to mislead or conceal any information or fact from the FCA, but nevertheless did fail to fully disclose all relevant information.  Pursuant to the review of these failures, the proposed individual controller, Mr Xu Bugai, was made aware of the seriousness of the omissions and of our decision that we agreed with your conclusion that Interstellar Markets Group Ltd should not be considered as an appropriate corporate controller. This means that Heidi Zhu will play no part in OGM going forwards.

5.  Next Steps

However, we do still believe that Mr Xu Bugai is still a fit and proper person to be considered as a controller, and the omission of the second Chinese address was an administrative/clerical error: the result of an interpretative/communication mistake with the UK based director and team, and not an intentional lack of transparency with the regulator.  As our proposal is that Heid Zhu and Interstellar Markets Group Ltd be removed from the proposed structure, we would advise that OGM's management team will now exclusively be communicating directly with him going forward to avoid any further misunderstandings.

We would like to restate our support for Mr. Xu Bugai's application.  As a long-established  entrepreneur and private investor - this transaction represents a vote of confidence in the UK, as well as in OGM and its people.  Mr. Bugai has already committed substantial capital and resources into OGM via this transaction and intends to deliver even more in his commitment to the firm and its management team through this investment into the UK. 

We would kindly note further that in all prior instances, Mr. Bugai's applications processed by the FCA have encountered issue and concern not at the hands of, or as a result of Mr. Bugai himself, but rather as a consequence of personnel that had been positioned around him in support of these applications on the advice or insistence of 3rd parties who did not always act in the best interests of their client, Mr. Bugai.  As witnessed  once again in this application. We wish to now  remove any such obstacle or impediment by way of our proposal for Mr. Bugai to engage directly as the sole and primary principle through which we attempt to find an amicable solution for this transaction, with your offices and pursuant to entrenching the succession planning OGM's management team have been working so diligently on for many months now.

We remain committed to finding a path forward that satisfies the FCA's concerns while protecting the long-term viability of a long-standing and proud regulated firm that has served its clients diligently for nearly a decade.

We thank you again for your time and for the opportunity to clarify our position and any unfortunate mis-characterisations or confusions any past correspondence or communications may have led to.

We trust this correspondence provides valuable clarifications and essential context to this matter, and we look forward to engaging with you further on an appropriate way forward from here and that our dialogue reflect the reality of of what this transaction truly is - a succession plan, not a transformation, but a continuity of stewardship, and not a risk event.

Yours sincerely,


[Your Name]

Director, One Global Market Limited
