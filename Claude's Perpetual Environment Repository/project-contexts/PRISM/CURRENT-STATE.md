2. **Wind-Down API Completion** - Full CRUD for Wind-Down
3. **Stress Testing API** - Expose results for OFAR consumption
4. **Reverse Stress Testing** - Outstanding regulatory requirement

Highlights:
- V1 is complete ICARA process (nothing more, nothing less)

- SaaS model, £99/user, minimum 3 seats
- Two-tier strategy: compliance tool (door opener) + data platform (real value)
