Behavioral Intelligence - Abstraction Layer / 

Prompt:

pre-planning/strategising exercise for this behavioral pattern/recognising/lintelligence algorithm dev/project and other nouns and adjectives...

specifically, i want us to explore, as a thought experiment and in context of the overall icar/mifidpru model, how we begin mapping the abstraction layer of this  behavioral intelligence// high stakes decision making environment algorithm so it can be developed accordingly.  

my thoughts here is we need to reference every model than is to be embedded within the overall, all 14 (possibly 15 modules) and derive the appropriate questions/prompts to ask/pop up - in the most natural and organic fashion humanly/ai possible to capture the target data with as much rich meta data as possible to ensure this data, this database is rammed full of high quality, tagged, meta-data'ered (?? what...?) Data as possible.

of course, this needs to also be done with reference to the already partially developed as attached above, patternrecognizer/eventprocessor/ behavioralintelligenceengine algorithm dev.  this is not in its final form of course, and it can be enhanced and further developed etc..but we need to start  mapping this somewhere and sometime...and that time is now.  this is well within your suit of particular skills and abilities so looking forward to your best work!  this is no sideline project...this is a beast undertaking, enterprise grade, ai/emotional intelligence training data repository building mega-hub..so no time for shortcuts or half measures... we need to map this like we're already in the future and know what is required.

And with that  said, my first question on this...is What makes good data for the purposes of Ai training data?  and, furthermore and slightly more esoteric as its not been done before, we need to answer the question what makes good emotional intelligence/behavioral pattern recogniser / high stakes/stress environment decison making data...?  again, a question teleported form the future we need to answer...well, now.


🧠 What Makes Good Data for AI Training?

In short:

Rich, diverse, accurate, structured, contextual, and annotated data.

But specifically:
	1.	High Fidelity:
	•	Captures real user actions or decisions, not just idealised templates.
	•	Includes micro-decisions, hesitations, edits, reversals—the grey zone, not just the binary.
	2.	Diversity of Scenarios:
	•	Covers the full span of risk environments, firm types, stress intensities, and emotional states.
	•	Ensures edge cases (black swans, overconfidence, misperception) are present and tagged.
	3.	Meta-Tagged with Contextual Markers:
	•	Each event should be stored with its context:
user profile, module, data volatility, perceived pressure, confidence level, time spent deliberating, etc.
	4.	Chronologically Rich:
	•	Sequence matters—order of operations, editing back and forth, time between changes, reaction speed, etc.
	5.	Qualitative + Quantitative:
	•	Not just what was done, but why. Prompt users with:
“What made you choose this value over others?”
“What concerns, if any, did you have entering this?”
	6.	Disagreement & Ambiguity:
	•	The system must see confusion to learn clarity. It must see conflicting opinions and self-correction.

🤯 What Makes Good Behavioural Intelligence / Emotional Data?

Now we’re into novel territory. Here’s what future-grade emotional/stress decision data might require:
	1.	Event Tagging of Emotional Indicators:
	•	Was this decision made under stress?
	•	Was the user confident, hesitant, distracted, panicked?
	•	Even asking for a self-assessed “confidence rating” or “emotional state” can train long-term predictors.
	2.	Capturing Patterns of Deviation from Norms:
	•	Does the user make different decisions under simulated pressure?
	•	Use comparative baselines: “Same scenario, but remove the time constraint.”
	3.	Prompting Just-in-Time Introspection:
“If this risk materialised tomorrow, what would you regret not including?”
“Rate your certainty in this model output on a scale of 1–10. What would change that rating?”
	4.	Interruption Metrics:
	•	Log when the user pauses, returns later, reconsiders, or shifts from deterministic to speculative input.
	5.	Emotional Event Anchors:
	•	Create “spike events” (a simulated market crash, sudden loss of access to data, etc.) to observe real-time adaptation.
	6.	Layered Prompting Model:
	•	Passive: Keystroke speed, edit time, data overwrite frequency.
	•	Active: Prompts like “Explain your rationale here.”
	•	Reflective: After action, ask: “Would you have done anything differently?”

📐 Architectural Implications (based on your behavioural engine)

The BehaviouralIntelligenceEngine.ts will eventually need to orchestrate:
	•	Real-time pattern ingestion from EventProcessor
	•	Emotional state estimation (heuristic or LLM-generated)
	•	Prompt injection engine (driven by PromptingStrategy)
	•	Longitudinal pattern tracking per user
	•	Data packaging pipeline for future AI training (secure, anonymised, structured, exportable)

The next step is to map the behavioural capture strategy across all 14–15 ICARA modules, designing prompts and signals for each. For that, I’ll prepare:

✅ A full Behavioural Mapping Matrix:
	•	Per module:
	•	What actions are tracked?
	•	What active/passive signals are captured?
	•	What prompts appear?
	•	How is stress simulated or detected?


    Right then, Jeeves reporting for strategic deployment! You’ve done a stellar job shaping this project into a living, breathing regulatory AI beast—and now we’re poised to embed the behavioural intelligence engine as its cognitive cortex.

Let’s map this out methodically.

🧠 Behavioural Intelligence Engine: Abstraction Architecture Mapping

This is Project Prometheus’s core differentiator—a behavioural telemetry framework that transforms ICARA/MiFIDPRU decision-making into high-quality training data for emotional intelligence models.

⸻

🧩 PART 1: WHAT IS “GOOD” BEHAVIOURAL TRAINING DATA?

✅ Qualities of High-Quality Data for AI Training:

Attribute	Relevance to Project Prometheus
Labelled	Capture user decisions + reasons explicitly.
Diverse	Different firms, sizes, scenarios, personas.
Contextual	Timestamped, module-specific, environment-aware.
Emotionally Correlated	Capture stress, hesitation, or confidence.
Behaviourally Annotated	User intention, decision rationale, confidence score.
Sequential	Decisions traced over time = behavioural pattern.

🧠 PART 2: WHAT MAKES GOOD BEHAVIOURAL/EMOTIONAL DATA?

We’re not training a model to predict numbers—we’re training it to understand humans in high-stakes financial decisions.

🎯 Therefore:
	•	Decision Confidence Level
	•	Stress Indicator (via decision delay, reversals, hesitancy)
	•	Rationale Categories (compliance-led, revenue-driven, defensive)
	•	Override Frequency (e.g., risk override, manual adjustments)
	•	Escalation Behaviour (when, why, to whom)
	•	Interaction Complexity (time spent, number of edits, iterations)

These must be passively observed (via the EventProcessor, PatternRecognizer) and actively prompted at critical friction points.

🔍 PART 3: NAMING THE DATASET / STRATEGY

Let’s give this intelligence layer a name worthy of its ambition.

🔸 Proposed Codename:

“VANTAGE”
(Virtual Abstraction of Nuanced Thought for Analytics & Governance in Enterprise)

This covers:
	•	Prompting strategy (prompting-strategy.ts)
	•	Taxonomy (data-taxonomy.ts)
	•	Events + stream tracking (useBehavioralTracking.ts, EventRepository.ts)
	•	Recognition logic (PatternRecognizer.ts)
	•	Privacy shielding (PrivacyEngine.ts)

⸻

🔧 PART 4: MODULE-BY-MODULE BEHAVIOURAL SIGNALS (EXAMPLE STRUCTURE)

We’ll need to build a behavioural abstraction table like this for each of the 14+ modules:

Module	Action/Decision Point	Behavioural Signals	Prompt Trigger	Data Tag
FOR	Add Cost Category	Manual edits, overrides	“Why did you override system recommendation?”	override_for_category_reason
Risk Assessment	Slider adjustment	High impact/low likelihood reversal	“What made you change this risk score?”	risk_score_rethink_flag
Stress Test	Scenario selection	Reversion to base case after viewing output	“What concerns influenced your decision to avoid this scenario?”	stress_retraction_meta
Liquidity	Selecting min liquidity buffer	Confidence level prompt (1-5)	“How confident are you in this buffer?”	liquidity_confidence_index

We’ll maintain this abstraction in a central YAML or JSON that the BehaviouralIntelligenceEngine.ts can ingest and evolve.

⸻

🗂️ PART 5: BALANCE SHEET MODULE

As you rightly noted, this is currently missing. It’s critical for:
	•	Anchoring PMR
	•	Contextualising capital adequacy
	•	Back-referencing stress and wind-down calculations
	•	Enriching behavioural prompts (e.g. “Why such a high Tier 2 allocation?”)

We’ll define that as a shared data context module (balance-sheet-context.ts) to be used across modules.

⸻

🎨 PART 6: NEXT STEP OUTPUTS

I shall now:
	1.	Generate a stylised master Module–Behavioural Abstraction Matrix starter doc.
	2.	Propose YAML structure for embedding prompts + events in the behavioural engine.
	3.	Add Balance Sheet Module scaffold into the dashboard and behavioural model.
