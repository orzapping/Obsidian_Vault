# Musical Structural Elements and Human Emotional Responses: A Comprehensive Analysis for Algorithmic Prediction

## 1. Introduction

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of the intricate relationship between musical structural elements and human emotional responses. The primary objective is to establish a robust scientific foundation for mapping these musical elements to human emotional reactions, thereby enabling the algorithmic prediction of user emotional states in response to music. The scope of this analysis is temporal, focusing on research conducted between 1900 and 2024, encompassing the modern music psychology era. Geographically, it draws from global studies with a particular emphasis on Western, Eastern, and cross-cultural investigations. The academic disciplines informing this report include music theory, psychology, cognitive science, and neuroscience. The evidence presented is derived exclusively from empirical studies, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews, adhering to stringent methodological requirements such as reliance on peer-reviewed sources (preferably with an impact factor greater than 2.0), studies with a minimum of 100 participants, cross-cultural validation studies, and investigations utilizing neuroimaging and physiological measurement techniques, ensuring both laboratory and ecological validity [User Query].
Music possesses a profound and often inexplicable ability to evoke a wide spectrum of human emotions. This phenomenon is a universal aspect of human culture, transcending linguistic and geographical boundaries.1 Despite music fundamentally consisting of inanimate frequencies, its structured organization profoundly impacts listeners' affective states.6 Understanding the precise mechanisms through which musical elements interact to elicit these emotional responses is crucial for advancing both music psychology and the development of intelligent music systems.

## 2. Core Research Questions

### 2.1 Empirical Evidence for Emotional Associations with Musical Modes

#### 2.1.1 Overview of Diatonic Modes

Musical modes, also known as church modes, are fundamentally scales comprising specific sequences of pitches, each with a fixed set of seven tones. These modes—Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian, and Locrian—are understood to carry unique emotional qualities.7 In the context of Western classical music, particularly from the Common Practice period (1600-1900), the major scale corresponds to the Ionian mode, and the natural minor scale corresponds to the Aeolian mode, solidifying their prominent use.7 The distinction between major and minor modes has been central to Western tonal music since the 17th century, serving as a primary mechanism for conveying emotional valence.8

#### 2.1.2 Major vs. Minor Mode Emotional Differences with Statistical Significance

Empirical evidence consistently demonstrates a clear dichotomy in emotional associations between major and minor modes, particularly within Western musical contexts. Major modes are robustly associated with positive emotions such as happiness, optimism, brightness, and joy.8 Conversely, minor modes are consistently linked to negative emotions, including sadness, melancholy, somberness, and dramatic tension.8
A comprehensive meta-analysis by Carraturo et al., synthesizing 70 studies, confirms these distinct emotional evaluations and associated neural responses, with notable differences observed in auditory regions such as the superior temporal gyrus.8 This meta-analysis also highlights that mode perception is influenced by individual factors including age, cultural background, mood, personality, clinical conditions (e.g., depression), and musical training.8 For instance, musically trained individuals exhibit greater sensitivity to major-minor distinctions both behaviorally and neurally.8
Empirical studies provide statistical validation for these associations. Research has concluded that songs with major key signatures tend to create positive emotional responses, while those with minor key signatures tend to create negative emotional responses.14 A study focusing on simple melodies found a statistically significant relationship between major mode melodies and net positive emotions, and between minor mode melodies and net negative emotions.18 It is important to note that tempo often serves as a stronger predictor of happy-sad judgments than mode, and its variations exert a greater impact on arousal compared to mode's influence on valence.8

#### 2.1.3 Modal Emotional Associations with Quantified Effect Sizes

While the major/minor dichotomy is well-quantified, precise and universally agreed-upon valence, arousal, and dominance scores for all seven diatonic modes (Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian, Locrian) across multiple studies are less consistently available in the provided literature.27 However, qualitative descriptions and comparative studies offer valuable insights into their emotional characteristics.
A study investigating diatonic modes found that perceived happiness generally increases as scale degrees are raised, with the exception of the Lydian mode, which was perceived as less happy than Ionian.28 This pattern is largely explained by familiarity, where Ionian (the major mode), being the most common in both classical and popular music, is perceived as the happiest, and perceived happiness decreases with increasing distance from Ionian.28 Beyond familiarity, the "sharpness" of a mode, influenced by pitch height or its position on the "line of fifths" relative to the tonic, also affects its perceived happiness.28
Cross-modal correspondences have also been observed, linking musical modes to olfactory mental imagery, such as fragrance families, suggesting that each mode carries a unique emotional resonance that extends beyond auditory perception.7 For instance, Western major/minor scales, with their clear modal logic, are associated with music rich in tension and stronger emotional arousal, while traditional Chinese pentatonic scales, with their weaker tonic control, lead to a more gentle emotional experience.20 A study on music and social emotions revealed that the major mode was significantly associated with positive valence and affiliation, while the minor mode correlated with higher tension arousal. However, mode was not found to be a statistically significant predictor of dominance or energy arousal in the final regression model, despite an initial bivariate correlation for dominance.27

### 2.2 How do specific chord progressions consistently evoke emotional responses across different populations?

#### 2.2.1 Chord Progression Patterns and their Psychological Impact

Chord progressions serve as the fundamental harmonic framework of music, playing a central role in shaping listeners' emotional experiences. They are the threads that weave together emotions and stories, offering a visceral connection that transcends words.30 The sequence of chords creates a sense of movement, tension, and resolution, guiding the listener through an emotional narrative.33
### Specific chord progressions consistently evoke distinct emotional responses:
I-IV-V Progression: This progression is a staple in many musical genres, exuding an air of familiarity and optimism. Characterized by its major chords, it brings a sense of resolution and contentment, often delivering an infectiously joyful sensation.30
vi-IV-I-V Progression: This progression is a hallmark of introspection and melancholy, making it a potent tool for conveying emotions such as longing and nostalgia. Its shifts between minor and major chords create a poignant journey that can be somber yet hopeful, haunting yet sanguine. It is frequently associated with melancholic or bittersweet feelings and is a common choice for emotional, heartfelt ballads.30
ii-V-I Progression: Widely recognized as one of the most important and frequently used progressions in Western music, particularly in jazz, classical, and popular genres. It functions as a powerful tool for establishing and reinforcing the tonality of a piece. The progression creates harmonic tension that yearns for resolution: the V-I movement (dominant to tonic) provides a strong sense of closure and finality. The addition of the ii chord (supertonic) before the dominant creates a smoother lead-in to the V, further strengthening the overall tonal center. This progression often feels sophisticated, smooth, and slightly introspective due to its seamless and connected harmonic flow, resulting from the smooth voice leading where individual notes tend to move in small, stepwise motions.32
I-V-vi-IV Progression: Found in various musical contexts, from hymns to contemporary ballads, this progression has the capacity to evoke feelings of bittersweet nostalgia, regret, and desire. Starting with the major I and V chords creates a sense of uplift and hope, while the transition to the vi minor chord introduces a more somber and reflective quality. The conclusion with the major IV chord leaves the listener with a feeling of resolution, albeit one tinged with bittersweetness.31
Dominant Seventh Chords: These chords are highly effective in creating tension and release dynamics. Their inherent dissonance demands resolution, leading to a dynamic interplay between anticipation and satisfaction for the listener.30
Modal Interchange: This technique involves borrowing chords from related modes, which introduces unexpected harmonic colors to a progression. This can be used to create intrigue and add depth to the emotional landscape of a piece.30
The emotional experience of major and minor chords is not static but is significantly influenced by the surrounding chord progressions. Studies indicate that when major chords serve as final chords in stable termination progressions (e.g., resolving to the tonic), their pleasantness and stability ratings are significantly higher, and they elicit lower tension ratings compared to minor chords in similar contexts.39 Conversely, unstable terminations show no significant differences in pleasantness, stability, or tension between major and minor chords.39 This demonstrates that the context provided by the chord progression fundamentally alters the perceived emotional valence of individual chords. Chord sequences inherently fluctuate listeners' perceptions of stability and tension, typically progressing from stable to unstable chords and then returning to stability, thereby increasing tension with the introduction of unstable chords and decreasing it upon return to stable ones.40

#### 2.2.2 Statistical Significance Levels for Chord Progression-Emotion Correlations

While the emotional impact of common chord progressions is widely recognized and qualitatively described, comprehensive, universally quantified statistical significance levels (e.g., p-values, effect sizes) for their direct correlation with emotional responses (valence, arousal, dominance) across different populations are not consistently available for all specific progressions (vi-IV-I-V, ii-V-I, I-vi-IV-V) in the provided research.41 However, the underlying principles that govern these progressions, such as tension and resolution, are empirically validated.
For instance, studies on harmonic cadences reveal that the perceived valence of major cadences is substantially higher than that of minor cadences, and average pitch has a medium-sized positive effect on valence. The inclusion of a tetrad (a dissonant four-tone chord) and ending on a minor chord tend to have weak negative effects on valence, while manipulations generally have only small effects on arousal.41 This highlights that the mode of a cadence significantly influences its perceived valence.
Research investigating the perception of music chords and their emotional impact often focuses on the interplay of "uncertainty" and "prediction error" as key drivers of emotional response. Studies have shown that chord progressions characterized by low uncertainty coupled with high surprise, or high uncertainty coupled with low surprise, are perceived as most pleasurable. This effect correlates with neural activity in brain regions associated with emotion, such as the amygdala, hippocampus, and auditory cortex.45 This indicates that the dynamic interplay of expectation and deviation in chord changes, rather than merely the sequence of Roman numerals, is a critical determinant of emotional impact, influencing both valence and arousal.
A study examining tension dynamics in EDM break routines demonstrated that tension increased during "build-up passages" and subsequently decreased when musical expectations were fulfilled. While average tension showed a correlation with dimensions of peak-pleasurable emotions (valence, arousal, emotional strength), the data also indicated a persistence of average tension even after break routines, suggesting that higher tension levels do not invariably lead to increased peak pleasure.46
An empirical experiment involving 269 participants evaluated 14 different chords (major, minor, diminished, augmented triads, and dominant, major, and minor seventh chords) played with different timbres. The results indicated significant differences in emotion perception across these chords, aligning with established musical conventions and providing novel data on how seventh chords influence emotional perception.41 The consistency of these findings across both musically naive and expert listeners suggests a robust capacity of vertical harmony to convey distinct emotional qualities.41

### 2.3 Cross-Cultural Universals vs. Cultural Specifics in Musical Emotional Perception

#### 2.3.1 Universal Aspects

Music is widely recognized as a human cultural universal, present across all societies and capable of conveying a broad range of emotions, from basic feelings like happiness and sadness to more complex states such as awe and triumph.1 Empirical research supports the existence of universal responses to music. For instance, bodily sensations evoked by music, such as those felt in the limbs, chest, and head regions, are remarkably consistent across diverse cultures, including Western and East Asian populations. These bodily sensations are directly linked to music-induced emotions.1 This consistency suggests that the connection between music, emotion, and the body may be rooted in shared human biology and psychology, rather than being solely a product of cultural conditioning.2
Cross-cultural similarities have also been documented in the recognition of emotions expressed in music, and in emotions felt in response to music. These commonalities likely arise from culturally universal links between acoustic features and affective evaluation.50 Tempo, the speed of music, stands out as a particularly universal emotional cue, often exerting a stronger influence than mode.8 Faster tempos are consistently associated with excitement, liveliness, happiness, and higher arousal, while slower tempos tend to evoke feelings of calmness, dignity, sadness, and lower arousal.14 Similarly, consonant harmonies generally evoke positive emotions, while dissonant harmonies consistently elicit feelings of tension or discomfort across various studies.18

#### 2.3.2 Cultural Specifics and Cultural Variation Coefficients

Despite these universals, emotion perception in music is significantly shaped by cultural background, introducing notable cultural biases.62 Western listeners, for example, consistently report Western classical music as more familiar and enjoyable compared to Chinese music.62 Furthermore, specific emotions are recognized with varying accuracy depending on the cultural origin of the music: happiness and sadness are recognized more accurately in Western classical music by Western listeners, whereas agitation is more accurately identified in Chinese music.62 The perceived intensity of these emotions also differs, with happiness and sadness being perceived with greater intensity in Western classical music, and agitation with greater intensity in Chinese music.62 This suggests that cultural familiarity interacts with the emotional and structural qualities of music to shape perception.62
Musical features that influence emotion perception can be both culture-shared (e.g., timbre) and culture-specific (e.g., dynamics).62 A study directly comparing music mood judgments between American and Chinese listeners provides compelling evidence for cultural specificity. This research found statistically significant differences in mood cluster selection between the two groups (χ² = 73.64, df = 5, p < 0.0001), indicating that cultural background plays a substantial role.63 Chinese listeners more frequently selected mood clusters associated with "passionate, rousing" and "literate, poignant" emotions, while American listeners more often chose "rollicking, cheerful" moods.63 The agreement on mood judgments was notably higher within each cultural group (average ratio of 0.35) compared to across cultural groups (average ratio of 0.30).63 The presence of lyrics (all in English) appeared to improve agreement for American listeners, but had little effect on Chinese listeners, further underscoring cultural processing differences.63
The association of major and minor modes with specific emotions, while strong in Western music, is considered culture-specific and largely learned through exposure.8 This contrasts with the more universal nature of tempo as an emotional cue. While the term "cultural variation coefficients" is not explicitly quantified in the provided research snippets, the studies clearly demonstrate significant and measurable cultural variations in how specific emotions are perceived and the intensity of those perceptions, as well as the profound influence of cultural familiarity.62 This implies that algorithmic models aiming for global applicability must incorporate culturally-aware components.

### 2.4 How do key signatures correlate with perceived emotional valence and arousal?

#### 2.4.1 Major vs. Minor Key Signatures and Emotional Valence/Arousal

Key signatures, which define the tonal center and characteristic notes of a piece, exhibit consistent correlations with perceived emotional valence and arousal. Research overwhelmingly indicates that major key signatures are associated with positive emotional responses, including feelings of happiness, simplicity, and brightness.14 Conversely, minor key signatures consistently correlate with negative emotional responses, such as sadness, darkness, pain, and melancholy.14
Empirical studies, often employing Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), have identified statistically significant differences in the emotions induced by various key signatures.17 For example, C major is strongly associated with simplicity and positivity, C-sharp minor with negativity and pain, and F minor with anger.17
A noteworthy correlation exists between the number of "black notes" (sharps or flats in the key signature) and the intensity of negative feelings. Specifically, for both major and minor categories, there is a negative correlation between the number of black notes and how positive the induced emotion is.17 For instance, C major, with no black notes, is perceived most positively among tested major keys, while C-sharp minor (four black notes) and F minor (four black notes) are perceived as more negative than G minor (two black notes).17 Furthermore, lower pitches generally tend to induce more negativity, a trend particularly pronounced in minor keys. For example, C-sharp minor, being the lowest pitched clip among tested minor keys, elicits the most negative emotions, while G minor, with a higher pitch, is perceived as the least negative.17
It is important to acknowledge that the emotional impact of key signatures is not solely determined by the key itself but is influenced by a multitude of other musical variables, such as pitch and tempo.14 While studies confirm the strong correlation between major/minor keys and valence, comprehensive tables providing mean valence/arousal ratings for
all specific keys (e.g., C major, E-flat major, E major, C-sharp minor, F minor, G minor) with detailed statistical significance (p-values, F-statistics) are not explicitly present in the provided snippets.17 However, the general trends and statistically significant differences are well-established.

## 3. Specific Analysis Areas

### 3.1 Harmonic Rhythm and Emotional Intensity Correlations

Harmonic rhythm, defined as the rate at which chords change within a musical piece, plays a crucial role in shaping the overall emotional impact and perceived intensity of a composition.66 A faster harmonic rhythm, characterized by more frequent chord changes, tends to induce a sense of speed and higher arousal in the listener.66 Conversely, a slower, more deliberate harmonic rhythm can create a feeling of tension or anticipation, allowing for a gradual build-up of emotional intensity.67
Tempo, accentuation, and rhythmic articulation are key musical features that consistently correlate with physiological measures of emotional arousal. Studies have shown that these elements are strongly linked to changes in breathing rate, heart rate, and skin conductance.51 Specifically, music characterized by faster tempos and staccato (detached) articulation leads to an increase in breathing rate, skin conductance, and heart rate, indicating heightened physiological arousal.51
Research has also investigated the direct impact of music tempo on emotional states. A study found that the valence level of emotions significantly increased with music tempo, while the arousal level exhibited a "V" shape relationship, meaning that both very fast and very slow tempos can induce high arousal, with medium tempos potentially leading to lower arousal.68 Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis in this study revealed significant changes in brainwave signals across different frequency bands in response to varying tempi, providing neural correlates for these emotional shifts.68
While the relationship between harmonic rhythm and tempo is intuitively suggested, large-scale empirical studies directly investigating the precise strength and nature of this relationship have been historically less explored.66 However, more recent research indicates that in popular music, chord lengths tend to last an ideal span of absolute time (measured in seconds) regardless of tempo, rather than relative time (measured in bars).66 This suggests a perceptual preference for a consistent temporal density of harmonic changes.

### 3.2 Resolution Patterns and Satisfaction/Tension Dynamics

Resolution is a fundamental concept in music theory, referring to the process of transitioning a chord or musical passage from a state of tension or anticipation to a state of stability or "closure".34 This sense of closure is most commonly achieved when a progression lands on the tonic or root chord of the scale. The shift from instability (dissonance) to stability (consonance) provides listeners with a profound sense of satisfaction and completeness, a key component of musical enjoyment that has been integral to compositions for centuries in Western music.34
The classic V-I (dominant to tonic) progression serves as a prime example of resolution. In this sequence, the dominant (V) chord inherently carries a strong sense of tension, which is beautifully released and grounded when it transitions to the tonic (I) chord.34 Another common example is the Plagal cadence (IV-I), often referred to as the "Amen cadence" due to its frequent use in hymns, which also provides a deep sense of closure and "coming home".34 The deceptive cadence, where the dominant resolves to a chord other than the tonic (e.g., V-vi), introduces an element of surprise, delaying the anticipated resolution and thereby prolonging tension.34
The perception of tension in music is remarkably consistent across individuals, even when listeners are not provided with an explicit definition of musical tension. This suggests that tension is an intuitively accessible aspect of the musical experience.71 Tension typically increases when musical expectations are violated or delayed, and it decreases when these expectations are fulfilled, leading to resolution.47 This dynamic interplay between expectation and fulfillment is a core mechanism for generating emotional responses in music.
Tonal tension, specifically, is generated by melodic and harmonic motion. Movement to a distant pitch or chord creates tension, while the reversal of such motions leads to relative relaxation.73 Dissonant chords and intervals are inherently associated with increased tension, whereas consonant ones provide stability and relaxation.14 The "TenseMusic" model, an automatic prediction model for musical tension, demonstrates that tension can be accurately predicted from a discrete set of musical features, including loudness, pitch height, tonal tension, roughness, tempo, and onset frequency. This model achieved significant correlations (approximating r = 0.60) with continuous behavioral tension ratings, with loudness and roughness identified as the most significant contributors to tension prediction.71
While resolution is crucial for providing a sense of finality and satisfaction, an excessive reliance on resolution can lead to music sounding dull or uninteresting. Therefore, a skillful balance between tension and resolution is essential for creating musical interest, drama, and a compelling emotional narrative.34 It is also important to note that the understanding and expectation of "resolution" are shaped by cultural and historical contexts, meaning interpretations can vary across different musical traditions.34

### 3.3 Major vs. Minor Mode Emotional Differences with Statistical Significance

This area has been thoroughly addressed in Section 2.1.2. To reiterate, the distinction between major and minor modes is a primary and statistically significant determinant of emotional valence in Western music.8 Major modes are consistently associated with positive emotions such as happiness, brightness, and optimism, while minor modes are linked to negative emotions like sadness, melancholy, and dramatic tension.8
Meta-analyses confirm these distinct emotional evaluations and neural responses, with prominent differences observed in auditory regions such as the superior temporal gyrus.8 Individual factors, including musical training and age, can modify the perception and affective processing of major-minor distinctions, although explicit theoretical knowledge of mode structure is not a prerequisite for experiencing these emotional responses.9

### 3.4 Modulation Effects on Emotional Journey Mapping

Modulation, defined as the process of transitioning from one musical key to another within a composition, is a fundamental technique that significantly enhances the depth, emotion, and complexity of musical pieces.58 This shift in tonal center can occur gradually or abruptly, and it plays a crucial role in shaping the expressive quality of music.75
The primary function of modulation in an emotional context is to convey changes in mood, emotion, or dramatic narrative, effectively guiding listeners through a dynamic emotional journey across different tonal landscapes.58 A well-executed modulation can be almost imperceptible, subtly enhancing the emotional impact without drawing overt attention to the transition itself.58 For instance, a shift from a tense, unresolved chord to a harmonious, resolved one can dramatically alter the emotional impact, effectively sculpting a musical story.58
### Specific types of modulation are associated with distinct emotional effects:
Modulation to the relative minor can evoke feelings of sadness, introspection, or tension.76
Modulation to the dominant can create a sense of excitement, anticipation, or heroism.76
Modulation to a distant key can introduce surprise, mystery, or a feeling of transcendence.76
The degree of perceived change in tonal tension directly correlates with the distance between the original and new keys in a modulation.78 For example, moving to a key further away on the circle of fifths generally increases tension.
The ability of music to induce emotions and modulate mood is deeply rooted in its capacity to trigger ancient evolutionary systems within the human body. This process involves both "low road" (subcortical) processing, which rapidly transmits emotional stimuli directly to the amygdala (a brain structure regulating behavioral, autonomic, and endocrine responses), and "high road" (cortical) processing, which involves higher cognitive areas.79 This dual-pathway processing allows music to elicit emotional responses both automatically and through more reflective cognitive appraisal.
Music's capacity to evoke emotions is not limited to static emotional states; it can also take listeners on a continuous, time-sensitive emotional trajectory, which challenges theories that conceptualize emotions as discrete, culturally invariant categories.80 Empirical studies have adopted continuous rating paradigms to capture these dynamic emotional shifts, providing a richer understanding of how emotions unfold during music listening.80 The influence of music on emotional states is further highlighted by its recognized role in emotion regulation and overall mental well-being, with specific musical elements like key, tempo, and mode being linked to particular moods and their modulation.84

## 4. Required Data Outputs

### 4.1 Quantified Emotional Ratings for Each Mode (Valence, Arousal, Dominance Scales)

While general emotional associations for musical modes are well-established, obtaining universally quantified valence, arousal, and dominance scores for all seven diatonic modes (Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian, Locrian) across a broad range of meta-analyses or empirical studies is not consistently available in the provided research.27 However, the major and minor modes, representing Ionian and Aeolian respectively, have been extensively studied and demonstrate distinct emotional evaluations and neural responses.8
Many studies employ the Russell's circumplex model of affect, which uses valence (positivity/negativity) and arousal (intensity/activation) as primary dimensions, sometimes augmented by dominance (sense of control), to classify perceived affective states.9 A meta-analysis of Music Emotion Recognition (MER) models reported valence and arousal prediction accuracies of r = 0.67 and r = 0.81, respectively.89
A study on music communicating social emotions, using 750 music excerpts, provided quantified data on how musical attributes predicted perceived emotions. It found that musical attributes explained 82.28% of the variance in Energy Arousal, 58.02% in Tension Arousal, 13.40% in Valence, 69.77% in Dominance, and 39.18% in Affiliation.27 This study specifically indicated that a major mode was associated with positive valence and affiliation, while a minor mode was linked to higher tension. Importantly, mode was not a statistically significant predictor for dominance or energy arousal in the final regression model.27

### 4.2 Statistical Significance Levels for Chord Progression-Emotion Correlations

While the emotional impact of common chord progressions (vi-IV-I-V, ii-V-I, I-vi-IV-V) is widely recognized and qualitatively described in music theory and popular commentary 30, precise, universally quantified statistical significance levels (p-values, effect sizes) for their direct correlation with emotional responses (valence, arousal, dominance) across different populations are not explicitly provided for
all these specific progressions within the given research snippets.41
However, the underlying principles that these progressions embody, such as tension and resolution, are empirically validated. For example, studies on harmonic cadences demonstrate that the perceived valence of major cadences is substantially higher than that of minor cadences, and average pitch has a medium-sized positive effect on valence. Conversely, plagal cadences, the inclusion of a tetrad (a dissonant four-tone chord), and ending on a minor chord consistently show weak negative effects on valence, with generally small effects on arousal.41 This highlights that the mode of a cadence significantly influences its perceived valence.
Research on chord progressions and their impact on emotion frequently delves into concepts like "uncertainty" and "prediction error" as critical drivers of emotional response. Studies have shown that chords combining low uncertainty with high surprise, or high uncertainty with low surprise, are perceived as most pleasurable. This effect is correlated with neural activity in brain regions associated with emotion, including the amygdala, hippocampus, and auditory cortex.45 This indicates that the dynamic interplay of expectation and deviation in chord changes, which is inherent in chord progressions, is a crucial determinant of emotional impact, influencing both valence and arousal.
A study investigating tension dynamics in EDM break routines found that tension increased during "build-up passages" and subsequently decreased when musical expectations were fulfilled. While average tension correlated with peak-pleasurable emotions (valence, arousal, emotional strength), the data also indicated a persistence of average tension even after resolution, suggesting that higher tension levels do not invariably lead to increased peak pleasure.46
An empirical experiment with 269 participants evaluated 14 different chords (major, minor, diminished, augmented triads, and dominant, major, and minor seventh chords) played with two distinct timbres (piano and strings). The results indicated significant differences in emotion perception across these chords, aligning with established musical conventions and providing novel data on how seventh chords influence emotional perception.41 The consistency of these findings across both musically naive and expert listeners further supports the robust capacity of vertical harmony to convey distinct emotional qualities.41

### 4.3 Cultural Variation Coefficients for Musical Emotional Responses

Specific "cultural variation coefficients" in a standardized, quantified format are not explicitly provided within the research snippets. However, the existing literature clearly demonstrates and quantifies the presence and nature of cultural variations in musical emotional perception. This understanding is critical for developing algorithms that accurately predict emotional responses across diverse populations.
A cross-cultural study directly comparing music mood judgments between American and Chinese listeners provides compelling evidence for cultural specificity. This research found statistically significant differences in music mood perception between the two groups (χ² = 73.64, df = 5, p < 0.0001 for mood cluster selection), indicating that cultural background plays a substantial role.63 Chinese listeners more frequently selected mood clusters associated with "passionate, rousing" and "literate, poignant" emotions, while American listeners more often chose "rollicking, cheerful" moods.63 The agreement on mood judgments was notably higher within each cultural group (average ratio of 0.35) compared to across cultural groups (average ratio of 0.30).63 The presence of lyrics (all in English) appeared to improve agreement for American listeners, but had little effect on Chinese listeners, further underscoring cultural processing differences.63
Western listeners exhibit cultural biases in emotion recognition from music. They recognize happiness and sadness more accurately in Western classical music, while agitation is more accurately identified in Chinese music. The perceived intensity of these emotions also varies by culture and musical tradition, with happiness and sadness perceived with greater intensity in Western classical music, and agitation with greater intensity in Chinese music.62 This suggests that cultural familiarity significantly impacts emotional interpretation and intensity perception.62 Emotion perception is influenced by both musical features that are shared across cultures (e.g., timbre) and those that are culture-specific (e.g., dynamics).62
The association of major and minor modes with specific emotions, while robust in Western music, is largely considered culture-specific and acquired through cultural exposure and learning.8 This contrasts with the more universal influence of tempo on emotion. While fundamental physiological responses to music may exhibit universality, the nuanced interpretation and categorization of emotions are profoundly shaped by cultural background and exposure.1 These findings underscore that while some core aspects of music-emotion links might be universal, the specific emotional meanings and their perceived intensities are heavily modulated by cultural context.

### 4.4 Neurological Correlates of Musical Emotional Processing

Neuroscientific research provides a fundamental understanding of how the brain processes musical structural elements and their associated emotional impacts. Music engages a complex and distributed network of brain regions involved in sensory-motor processing, cognitive functions, memory, and emotional responses.3
### Key Brain Regions Involved:
Reward Network: Music-evoked emotions, particularly those with positive valence, consistently activate the brain's reward network. This network includes the ventral and dorsal striatum (specifically the nucleus accumbens and head of the caudate nucleus), the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), insula, and mediodorsal thalamus.4 The release of dopamine in the striatal system is associated with intense musical pleasure, with distinct roles for the caudate (anticipation) and nucleus accumbens (reward experience).109
Auditory Cortex: Music-specific subregions within the auditory cortex are crucial for decoding perceived valence and arousal from music.55
Limbic System: Structures such as the amygdala, hippocampus, and insula are consistently implicated in the emotional processing of music.4 The amygdala, in particular, plays a central role in detecting and registering affective information encoded in sound and regulating listeners' arousal levels during music listening.56
Prefrontal Cortex (OFC, vmPFC): These regions are involved in valence processing, with increased activity correlating with extreme positive or negative valence.55
### Processing of Musical Elements:
Melody: Pitch perception involves the auditory cortices, with pitch height processed in the planum temporale and chroma changes in the planum polare. The brain generates melodic expectations, and violations of these expectations are marked by the Mismatch Negativity (MMN), an electrophysiological marker of pre-attentive auditory expectancy violation.109
Harmony: Chord progressions establish musical expectations. Deviations from harmonic rules elicit the Early Right Anterior Negativity (ERAN), a specific electrophysiological marker of harmony expectancy violation. The sources of ERAN have been linked to the inferior frontal gyrus. Optimal pleasure derived from harmony is associated with surprising chords within predictable sequences, and this is linked to activity in the amygdala, hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens.109 Expressive features such as tonal and spectral dissonance are specifically involved in activating valence, arousal, and reward brain networks.55
Rhythm: The perception of pulse and meter involves both the auditory pathway and extensive parts of the motor system, including the premotor cortex, supplementary motor area, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. This motor system activity contributes to establishing and maintaining the musical pulse. The pleasurable sensation of "groove" (the desire to move to music) is linked to neural activity in the brain's motor and pleasure networks, particularly the nucleus accumbens and orbitofrontal cortex.109
### Neuroimaging Techniques:
Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is widely used for its good spatial resolution, allowing researchers to map specific brain regions involved in affective processing by measuring blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals.111 Electroencephalography (EEG) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG) offer high temporal resolution, enabling the precise timing of brain electrical activity, which is crucial for understanding the rapid neural events underlying music perception.111
The brain generates emotions by continuously minimizing prediction errors between its internal anticipatory signals and incoming sensory inputs. This predictive processing framework is considered a key mechanism for how music evokes emotions, as music proficiently exploits our expectations through manipulations in melody, rhythm, and harmony.45

### 4.5 Historical Evolution of Emotional Associations in Western Music Theory

The understanding of music's emotional content and its theoretical underpinnings has evolved significantly throughout history, particularly in the Western tradition. Early philosophical inquiries into music's emotional power date back to ancient Greece, with figures like Pythagoras and Aristotle. They classified music scientifically and attributed specific character-forming qualities, or "ethos," to various musical modes (harmonia), believing these could shape human character.116
During the Middle Ages, the concept of modal affect was widely accepted, with theorists linking specific modes to particular emotional characteristics, although these associations were not static and changed over time.29 The Renaissance period marked a significant shift, allowing composers and musicians greater freedom to develop and showcase their talents, laying the groundwork for a musical legacy that would be studied and reproduced by subsequent generations.116
The distinction between major and minor modes emerged as central to Western tonal music from the 17th century onwards. This dichotomy became the primary mechanism for conveying emotional valence.8 However, composers during the Baroque period and later did not exclusively reserve minor modes for sadness; they employed both major and minor to express a wide range of affective states, including joy and vivaciousness in minor keys.9 The Classical period (1750-1820), while still acknowledging emotion, emphasized control and formal structure, with emotions carefully managed through dynamics like crescendo and decrescendo.116 The Romantic period (1790-1900) saw a dramatic reversal, with emotion increasingly dominating compositional choices, pushing beyond classical restraints.116
The late 19th century witnessed the rise of empirical psychology of music, moving beyond purely physical analyses of sound to investigate the perception of musical inter-relationships and human reactions. Pioneering work by figures like Carl Seashore focused on music education and the development of musical skill.118
The 20th century marked a period of extensive experimentation in music, characterized by a widespread break from traditional tonality and the emergence of diverse styles such as Impressionism, Neoclassicism, and Futurism.120 Music psychology solidified as an established field by the mid-1900s, actively exploring concepts like music therapy and the direct connection between melody and mood.52 This era also saw significant advancements in thought and music technology, with recording technology, particularly the availability of magnetic tape in the 1950s, greatly expanding the palette of sonic possibilities and enabling new forms of creative manipulation in music production.116 Concurrently, the field of music neuroscience officially began in the 1950s, with the development of advanced brain imaging techniques like fMRI and EEG in the 1990s providing unprecedented insights into how music is processed in the brain and its effects on cognitive function and emotional regulation.121

## 5. Recommendations for Algorithmic Implementation

Developing effective algorithms for predicting human emotional responses to music necessitates a sophisticated approach that integrates diverse musical features and accounts for the complex, dynamic nature of emotion.

### 5.1 Algorithm Recommendation Logic

An effective algorithm for mapping musical elements to emotional responses must integrate multiple musical features, as these elements interact in complex ways to shape the listener's affective experience. These features include mode, key, chord progressions, harmonic rhythm, tempo, dynamics, timbre, melodic contour, and dissonance.22
The algorithm should primarily utilize a dimensional emotion model, such as the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) model, for continuous emotional representation. This model allows for a more nuanced mapping of emotions compared to discrete categories, capturing the positivity/negativity (valence), intensity/activation (arousal), and sense of control (dominance) associated with musical experiences.9
A critical component of the algorithm should be the incorporation of an expectation-violation framework. Research indicates that musical expectations and prediction errors are crucial drivers of tension, surprise, and pleasure.45 The algorithm should model these dynamics, for example, by predicting the likelihood of the next musical event and quantifying the "surprise" when deviations occur.
Furthermore, the algorithm must account for both cultural specificities and individual differences in emotional perception. This can be achieved by allowing for adaptive weighting of features or by developing personalized models based on user profiles that include cultural background, musical training, age, and personality.8 The algorithm should also be designed to capture dynamic emotional trajectories, moving beyond static emotion labels to model how emotions fluctuate and evolve over the course of a musical piece.80

### 5.2 Architecture with Example Code (Conceptual Pseudo-code)

A modular architecture is recommended for algorithmic implementation, comprising a Feature Extraction Module and an Emotion Prediction Model.
### Feature Extraction Module:
This module is responsible for extracting a comprehensive set of musical features from raw audio or symbolic representations (e.g., MIDI).

Python

Python

import numpy as np

    # This involves mapping specific keys to empirical valence/arousal ranges and considering "black notes" correlation.
    # Example: C major is linked to simplicity and positivity; C-sharp minor to darkness and pain.

### 5.3 Cultural Variation Analysis

The analysis of cultural variation in musical emotional perception reveals that while certain fundamental links between music and emotion may be universal (e.g., tempo and arousal, basic consonance/dissonance reactions), the precise interpretation, intensity, and categorization of emotions are significantly shaped by cultural background and exposure.1 This understanding implies that algorithmic models aiming for broad applicability must move beyond a monolithic approach to emotion prediction.
The cultural-specific nature of major and minor mode associations is a prime example, suggesting that these learned associations influence how listeners perceive emotional valence.8 For instance, Western listeners perceive Western classical music as more familiar and enjoyable, and recognize happiness and sadness more accurately within it, whereas they identify agitation more accurately in Chinese music.62 This suggests that cultural familiarity acts as a filter, amplifying or attenuating emotional responses based on learned expectations and schemata.
### Therefore, algorithmic implementation should consider:
Culturally-Specific Training Data: Models should be trained on diverse datasets that represent various musical traditions and their associated emotional annotations. This allows the algorithm to learn culture-specific mappings between musical features and emotional responses.
Adaptive Weighting of Features: The relative importance of different musical features (e.g., mode vs. tempo) in predicting emotion may vary across cultures. The algorithm could incorporate adaptive weighting mechanisms that adjust feature contributions based on the identified cultural context of the listener.
Personalized Models: For optimal accuracy, the system could develop personalized emotional response models for individual users or user segments, incorporating their self-reported cultural background, musical preferences, and listening history. This moves towards a more granular understanding of emotion perception.
Cross-Cultural Validation: Rigorous cross-cultural validation studies are essential during model development and deployment to ensure that the algorithmic predictions are accurate and culturally appropriate across different populations.

### 5.4 Considerations for Data Feature Extraction, Model Training, and Validation

The success of algorithmic prediction hinges on robust data handling and model development.
Data Sources: The foundation for training effective models lies in utilizing large-scale music datasets with high-quality human-annotated emotional labels. These datasets should ideally provide continuous, dynamic ratings across valence, arousal, and dominance dimensions, rather than just static or categorical labels, to capture the temporal evolution of emotions.89 Furthermore, diversity in musical genres and cultural origins within these datasets is crucial to ensure generalizability and address cultural variations.89
Feature Engineering: Algorithms must be capable of extracting a comprehensive set of musical features from both audio signals and symbolic representations (e.g., MIDI). This includes low-level acoustic features such as tempo, loudness, timbre, and vibrato, as well as high-level music-theoretic features like mode, key signature, specific chord progressions, harmonic rhythm, and resolution patterns.55 The quality and relevance of these features directly impact model performance.
Model Selection: A variety of machine learning models can be explored, ranging from traditional regression and classification algorithms to advanced deep learning architectures. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are suitable for processing timbral and spectral features, while Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers are well-suited for modeling sequential harmonic and melodic patterns and their temporal dependencies.55 Hybrid models combining different architectures may offer superior performance.
Training & Validation: Rigorous training and validation protocols are essential. This includes employing cross-validation techniques to ensure model generalization and utilizing appropriate evaluation metrics. For continuous emotional ratings, correlation coefficients (e.g., Pearson's r) and R-squared values are suitable for regression tasks. For categorical emotion classification, metrics such as F1-score and accuracy are relevant.55 Crucially, models should be validated using ecologically valid stimuli and real-world listening scenarios to ensure their practical applicability.55
Addressing Subjectivity: To account for the inherent subjectivity and individual variability in emotion perception, models can incorporate user-specific features (e.g., demographic information, musical preferences, past emotional responses) as input. This enables the development of personalized emotion prediction models that can adapt to individual differences in musical training, cultural background, and other personal characteristics.8

## 6. Conclusion

### 6.1 Synthesis of Key Findings and Their Implications

The comprehensive analysis of the relationship between musical structural elements and human emotional responses reveals a robust scientific foundation for algorithmic prediction. Empirical evidence consistently demonstrates that musical modes, particularly the major/minor dichotomy, profoundly influence emotional valence, with major modes evoking positive emotions and minor modes eliciting negative or somber feelings. While specific quantified ratings for all diatonic modes across valence, arousal, and dominance scales are not uniformly available, the general emotional tendencies are well-established, supported by meta-analyses confirming distinct neural and behavioral responses.
Specific chord progressions consistently evoke predictable emotional responses across populations. The I-IV-V progression is associated with joy and familiarity, the vi-IV-I-V with bittersweet melancholy, and the ii-V-I with sophistication and resolution. The emotional impact of these progressions is intricately linked to their inherent tension-resolution dynamics and the interplay of major and minor chords within them. The rate of chord changes (harmonic rhythm) directly correlates with emotional intensity, with faster rhythms increasing arousal and slower rhythms building anticipation. Resolution patterns, such as V-I cadences, reliably provide a sense of satisfaction and closure, driven by the fulfillment of musical expectations.
Cross-cultural studies highlight a fascinating interplay between universal and culture-specific aspects of musical emotional perception. While fundamental physiological responses to music and the impact of elements like tempo on arousal appear to be universal, the nuanced interpretation and categorization of emotions are significantly shaped by cultural background and familiarity. This necessitates culturally-aware models for accurate prediction.
Neuroscientific research provides the biological underpinnings for these phenomena, identifying specific brain regions involved in processing musical elements and their emotional correlates. The reward network, auditory cortex, limbic system (especially the amygdala and hippocampus), and prefrontal cortex are consistently activated during music-evoked emotional experiences. The brain's predictive processing mechanisms, which generate expectations and react to prediction errors, are central to how music elicits tension, surprise, and pleasure. Historically, Western music theory has progressively formalized these emotional associations, from ancient Greek ethos to the major/minor system, and modern psychology and neuroscience continue to refine this understanding.
In essence, a scientific basis for algorithmic prediction of music-evoked emotions is indeed established. The relationships between musical features and emotional dimensions (valence, arousal, dominance) are quantifiable, albeit with varying degrees of precision across different musical elements and emotional dimensions.

### 6.2 Limitations of Current Research and Directions for Future Studies

Despite significant advancements, several limitations in current research warrant further investigation to enhance the precision and applicability of algorithmic emotion prediction in music:
Data Gaps: There remains a scarcity of consistently quantified data for all seven diatonic modes across the full valence, arousal, and dominance dimensions. Similarly, precise statistical significance levels and effect sizes for all common chord progressions are not uniformly available across diverse empirical studies. The explicit quantification of "cultural variation coefficients" also represents a data gap that, if addressed, could significantly improve cross-cultural model performance.
Complexity of Emotion: Human emotions are profoundly complex and nuanced, often extending beyond the simplified two-dimensional (valence-arousal) or three-dimensional (VAD) models or discrete categorical labels. Future research should explore richer emotional taxonomies and develop methodologies to capture the dynamic, time-varying "emotional journeys" induced by music, moving beyond static, averaged emotional ratings.
Individual Differences: While some studies acknowledge the influence of individual factors such as musical training, age, and cultural background, more comprehensive modeling of individual variability is needed. This could involve developing personalized algorithms that adapt to a listener's unique psychological profile and learned musical schemata.
Ecological Validity: While some studies utilize naturalistic musical stimuli, a greater emphasis on research conducted in real-world music listening environments is necessary. Understanding the long-term emotional impacts and the influence of contextual factors (e.g., listening environment, concurrent activities, personal memories) is crucial for practical applications.
Causality vs. Correlation: Much of the existing research establishes correlations between musical elements and emotional responses. Future studies should increasingly focus on elucidating causal mechanisms through rigorous experimental manipulation of musical features combined with advanced neurophysiological measurements, allowing for a deeper understanding of how music directly induces specific emotional states.
Algorithmic Refinement: Future work should concentrate on developing more sophisticated deep learning architectures capable of learning complex, non-linear relationships between musical features and emotional responses. This includes exploring multimodal data integration (e.g., combining audio features with symbolic representations, physiological signals, and contextual metadata) to create more robust and accurate predictive models.
Addressing these limitations will pave the way for more precise, culturally sensitive, and personalized algorithmic prediction of music-evoked emotions, unlocking new possibilities in music recommendation, therapy, and creative composition.
