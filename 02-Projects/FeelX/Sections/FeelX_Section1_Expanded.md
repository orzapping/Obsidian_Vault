# FeelX Framework 1: Abstract, Introduction & Methodology (Expanded)

## 📄 Abstract

This research investigates the systematic correlation between musical structure and human emotional responses. Leveraging insights from six state-of-the-art AI models—GPT-4 o3-pro, Claude Sonnet 4, DeepSeek Research, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Grok, and the Manus deep synthesis foundation—the FeelX Framework distills a universal emotional grammar of music.

Across tonal modes, chord progressions, harmonic rhythm, and resolution patterns, this study reveals consistent affective associations. Using multimodel triangulation, validated datasets (e.g., DEAM, PMEmo), and psychometric mapping (valence, arousal, dominance), the system builds a foundation for real-time emotional prediction in musical contexts.

## 🧭 Introduction

Music’s capacity to elicit, modulate, and encode emotion is both ancient and universally acknowledged. But how exactly does this occur? And can it be quantified, modelled, and reproduced? The FeelX Framework aims to formalise this intuitive understanding using a synthesis of music theory, affective computing, and large-scale empirical research.

This project is not merely theoretical—it is computationally actionable. The end goal is the creation of a personalisable emotion-response prediction engine embedded into applications ranging from therapy to film scoring, wellness, and generative AI music systems.

## 🧪 Methodology

### 1. **Model-Based Triangulation**

Each section of the FeelX Framework was answered independently by the following LLMs:
- GPT-4 o3-pro (OpenAI)
- Claude Sonnet 4 (Anthropic)
- DeepSeek Research Model
- Gemini 2.5 Pro & Flash (Google)
- Grok (xAI)
- Manus (Claude derivative, foundation synthesis report)

Outputs were compared for:
- Conceptual convergence
- Cross-model consensus
- Original contributions or divergences

### 2. **Comparative Thematic Synthesis**

Using qualitative comparative analysis (QCA), a thematic synthesis was applied to distil:
- Core emotional mappings per mode/chord/progression
- Consensus-based psychological interpretations
- Novel insights for further empirical testing

### 3. **Data-Driven Emotional Modelling**

Data sources included:
- **DEAM Dataset** – real-time emotional annotations of music
- **PMEmo Dataset** – pre-tagged emotional segments with acoustic features
- **FeelX Correlation Matrix** – compiled and standardised cross-model emotion data

These were used to refine predictive weights and effect sizes.

### 4. **Dimensional Emotion Modelling**

All emotional classifications use the **valence-arousal-dominance** model (VAD) as the backbone for FeelX’s predictive logic. Each musical feature (e.g., Lydian mode, ii–V–I progression) was tagged with expected coordinates in VAD space.

### 5. **Psychometric Anchoring**

Findings were cross-referenced with:
- Russell’s Circumplex Model of Affect
- Big Five Personality Trait mappings (Section 4)
- Affective Neuroscience foundations

This ensured psychological credibility and model generalisability.

### 6. **Validation Layer**

Each hypothesis and mapping is slated for:
- Statistical backtesting
- Controlled listener trials
- Cross-modal integration (Section 6)

This ensures FeelX’s emotional engine is not only logically derived but empirically sound.

This expanded section provides the foundation upon which the full FeelX system will be built. Future sections will carry this methodology forward into concrete emotional mappings, personalisation models, and cross-domain deployment.
