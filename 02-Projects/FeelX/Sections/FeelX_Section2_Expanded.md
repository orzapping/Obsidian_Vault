# FeelX Framework 1: Comparative Analysis of Core Sub-Questions (Expanded)

## 🎯 Overview

This section provides an in-depth comparative synthesis of the six AI models’ responses across the key research sub-questions. Each subsection captures model alignment, divergence, and thematic insight.

---

## 1. Emotional Associations with Musical Modes

### 🔍 Consensus Patterns
- **Ionian (Major):** Universally mapped to **positive valence**, **moderate arousal**.
  - Strong convergence across Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, and Manus.
- **Aeolian (Natural Minor):** All models noted **melancholic**, **introspective**, or **tragic** themes.
- **Phrygian & Locrian:** Noted by Grok and DeepSeek for **tension**, **unease**, **unresolved emotion**.
- **Lydian & Mixolydian:** Highlighted by Manus and Gemini Flash for **mysticism**, **hope**, and **playfulness**.

### 📌 Notable Divergences
- **Claude Sonnet** uniquely emphasised **philosophical** or **contemplative** associations with Dorian.
- **Grok** downplayed emotional clarity, suggesting high cultural variability.

## 2. Chord Progressions & Psychological Impact

### ✅ Agreement on Emotional Prototypes
- **vi–IV–I–V**: Labelled as **nostalgic-optimistic** in all models except Grok.
- **ii–V–I**: Interpreted as **resolving, affirming**; DeepSeek offered jazz-specific insights.
- **I–vi–IV–V**: Recognised for **sentimentality and romantic recall**.

### 📐 Analysis of Resolution & Tension
- Manus and Claude both highlighted the **dopaminergic effect of cadences**, aligning with neuroscientific theories.
- Gemini Flash provided a layered arousal/dominance map for each chord pair—unique among models.

---

## 3. Cultural Universals vs Specifics

### 🌐 Universals Identified
- All models cited **major-minor emotional distinction** as culturally consistent.
- Rhythm-emotion links (e.g. tempo with arousal) held across contexts.

### 🧭 Specifics Emphasised
- Claude: East Asian pentatonics vs Western diatonic effects.
- Manus: African polyrhythms → heightened group arousal.
- Gemini Flash: Latin harmonic minor progressions seen as **“melodically tragic”** only in Western listeners.

## 4. Key Signatures & Emotional Perception

### 🗺️ Valence-Arousal-Dominance Mapping (VAD)
- DeepSeek, Claude, and Gemini 2.5 Pro modelled **sharp keys** as arousing and **flat keys** as calming.
- Manus included spectral centroid values to anchor these impressions in signal physics.
- O3-pro provided a basic valence ladder by key, but lacked psychometric integration.

## 🧠 Implications

This synthesis enables us to:
- **Prioritise features** for inclusion in the algorithm’s emotional engine
- **Weight cross-model agreements** using a reliability confidence index
- Drive **empirical trials** around points of model divergence

This section informs the **feature selection**, **modelling strategy**, and **customisation logic** embedded into the FeelX system going forward.
