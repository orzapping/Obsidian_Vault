# FeelX Framework 1: Major vs Minor Mode Emotional Dynamics (Expanded)

## 🎵 Overview

The dichotomy of **major vs minor tonality** is one of the most robust emotional classifiers in Western music—and, as all models corroborated, a cornerstone for emotion prediction in algorithmic systems like FeelX.

---

## 1. Statistical Significance of Emotional Association

- **Claude Sonnet** and **Gemini Flash** both cited meta-analyses showing:
  - **Major keys**: Significantly correlated with **positive valence**, low-to-mid arousal.
  - **Minor keys**: Correlated with **negative valence**, mid-to-high arousal, and **higher emotional complexity**.

- **Manus** model layered this with EEG findings showing **differential prefrontal activation**—left dominance for major (positive), right for minor (melancholy or introspective states).

---

## 2. Cross-Cultural Considerations

- **Grok** raised a key limitation: the **major/minor dichotomy is culturally contingent**.
  - In some non-Western contexts (e.g., Indian classical), **scale intervals and raga context** override Western mode-emotion norms.
  - Nevertheless, DeepSeek confirmed that even in cross-cultural samples, **Western-trained listeners exhibited consistent emotional mapping**.

---

## 3. Ambiguity and Emotional Richness

- **Gemini Pro** introduced a "hybrid scale emotional density" model:
  - Modal mixtures (e.g., major scale with minor 6th) produced **ambiguous emotional states**—nostalgia, bittersweetness.
  - FeelX can capitalise on these **in-between tonalities** for nuanced scoring.

---

## 4. Subdominant-Minor & Parallel Modulation Effects

- **Claude and DeepSeek** noted **parallel modulation** (e.g. C major → C minor) as an emotionally jarring yet potent transition.
- Often used in cinematic scoring to **pivot emotional context mid-piece**.

## 5. Data Visualisation from Corpus

Derived from the FeelX Research Database:

| Mode Type     | Avg. Valence | Avg. Arousal | Dominance |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|-----------|
| Major         | +0.78        | +0.43        | High      |
| Minor         | -0.65        | +0.60        | Mid       |
| Dorian        | +0.30        | +0.55        | Mid       |
| Mixolydian    | +0.45        | +0.40        | High      |
| Aeolian       | -0.60        | +0.50        | Low-Mid   |

## 🎯 Application in FeelX

- Primary **valence engine weighting** will depend on **mode class**.
- Mode will serve as a **base layer**, enhanced by harmonic rhythm, cadence, and cultural priors.
- **Context-aware override** logic will adjust mode weighting for cinematic/genre-specific use cases.

The major-minor divide gives us **first-pass affective classification**—but FeelX’s strength lies in handling the ambiguity between and beyond.
