# FeelX Research – Framework 1: Music Theory & Emotional Psychology

## Executive Summary

This report consolidates insights from seven advanced AI models on the relationship between musical structure and human emotional response. It includes analysis of musical modes, chord progressions, cultural universals, and neurological correlates.

### Key Findings
- **Lydian and Ionian modes** consistently rate highest in valence.
- **Chord progressions involving surprise and uncertainty** create elevated physiological responses.
- **Cross-cultural universality** is highest for lullabies, maternal style, and basic emotional recognition.
- **Neural activity** strongly correlates in the auditory cortex and nucleus accumbens, especially in high-arousal harmonic patterns.

### Algorithmic Recommendations
- Build mode-weighted emotional mappings prioritising valence/arousal.
- Include cultural sensitivity coefficients for contextual weighting.
- Prioritise musical modes based on both frequency and Line of Fifths correlation with valence.
