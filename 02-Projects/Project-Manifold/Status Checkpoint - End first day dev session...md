Thinking: Pinpointing the Current Path
I've got the current working directory request pegged. Checking the environment or executing pwd should do the trick. Also, the session's concluded, so I'll wrap this up.
Verifying Current Location
I'm confirming the directory, /home/obsidan/Development/Projects/project-manifold, via pwd. Then, I'll provide the response and conclude.
# Confirm current working directory
$ pwd
/home/obsidan


We are currently in: /home/obsidan (the user root).

However, all our work tonight has been inside:

/home/obsidan/Development/Projects/project-manifold

Cheers, Chief. Catch you on the flip side. 🚀
