## 7. Audit Findings & Recommendations

### 7.1 Key Findings

| # | Finding | Severity | Status |
|:-:|---------|:--------:|--------|
| 1 | TMS calculation error (70/10/10/10 vs 70/10/20) | Medium | Remediation planned |
| 2 | Mariia settlement extended by AXA expense drag | Low | Expected behaviour |
| 3 | CBH concentration risk (76% revenue) | Medium | Diversification ongoing |
| 4 | No fraud or misappropriation detected | — | Clean audit |
| 5 | Bank statements reconciled to spreadsheet | — | Verified |

### 7.2 Recommendations

1. **Implement TMS Refactor** – Correct the 70/10/20 calculation logic per specification package delivered 26 December 2025

2. **Review Mariia's AXA Coverage** – Consider whether this individual expense should continue post-settlement clearance, or if it should transition to personal responsibility

3. **Continue Diversification** – Maintain momentum on TBC, Marex, and Vontobel relationships to reduce CBH dependency

4. **Formalise Expense Policy** – Document clear rules for shared vs individual expense classification to prevent future disputes

5. **Monthly Reconciliation Cadence** – Implement structured monthly close process with bank-to-spreadsheet verification
