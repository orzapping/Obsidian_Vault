**Date:** 13 December 2025  
**Prepared by:** Claude (AI Analysis)  
**Commissioned by:** Adrian Rader  
**Period Covered:** November 2024 – November 2025

## Executive Summary

### The Bottom Line

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| AR+NK Calculated Entitlement (per AS Spreadsheet) | £51,493.23 |
| AR+NK Actual Payments Received (per Bank) | £0.00 |
| **SHORTFALL** | **£51,493.23** |
| Per Partner (50/50) | £25,746.62 each |

**Status:** This money should be sitting in company accounts (Lloyds + Wise), reserved for but never paid to AR+NK.

---

## Key Findings

### Finding 1: Calculations Are Broadly Correct

AS's spreadsheet methodology is **sound**. An independent waterfall model calculation produced £48,232.84 – actually **less** than AS's spreadsheet figure of £51,493.23. There is **no evidence of fraudulent understatement** of AR+NK entitlement in the calculations.

The variance of ~£3,260 is likely due to:
- Minor rounding differences
- Slightly different allocation timing for settlement recoveries
- Expense allocation variations

### Finding 2: The Issue Is Non-Payment, Not Miscalculation

The spreadsheet correctly calculates what AR+NK are owed. The money simply hasn't been distributed. This is a **governance/operational failure**, not fraud.

### Finding 3: AS Appears Overpaid by ~£2,950

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| AS entitlement per spreadsheet | £76,355.46 |
| AS payments per bank statement | £79,305.16 |
| **Variance** | **£2,949.70 OVERPAID** |

**Possible explanation:** The £7,193.24 payment on 01-Nov-24 directly to "Anastasia Soldatova" (not Regent Consulting) may represent October 2024 revenue not captured in the spreadsheet calculations which commence from November 2024. Requires further investigation.

### Finding 4: Mariia's Perpetual Settlement

| Item | Amount/Status |
|------|---------------|
| Starting settlement | £15,551.00 |
| Outstanding (Nov-25) | £3,017.44 |
| Time elapsed | 13 months |
| Gross revenue generated | ~£66,000+ |

**Impact:** Her 20% waterfall tranche is **still flowing to settlement recovery**, not to AR+NK. Estimated impact: £250-400/month that would otherwise flow to AR+NK.

**Question:** Why is her settlement taking so long to clear given her revenue generation?

### Finding 5: Expense Classification Concerns

The spreadsheet deducts the following as "shared operational expenses":

| Expense | Amount (Annual) | Contractual Status |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| BUPA Health | ~£14,655 | **INDIVIDUAL** (not shared) |
| BUPA Dental | Included above | **INDIVIDUAL** (not shared) |
| AXA Health | ~£2,948 | **INDIVIDUAL** (not shared) |
| **Total Misclassified** | **~£17,600** | |

Per the Consultancy Agreements, only **HTL, 8x8, Salesforce, and WorldCheck** are legitimate shared operational expenses.

**Impact on AR+NK:** ~£3,543 reduction in their 20% share.

**Note:** Adrian has confirmed ORCAP is willing to absorb these costs. Documented here for the record.

## Settlement Clearance Timeline

| Advisor | Settlement | Cleared | Notes |
|---------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Maksat | £6,310 | January 2025 | Fast earner – significant overflow to AS |
| Sergey | £15,335 | January 2025 | Fast earner – significant overflow to AS |
| Anastasia | £11,685 | April 2025 | Cleared from Maksat/Sergey overflow |
| Nikolai | £6,378 | July 2025 | Slower recovery |
| Yulia | £2,657 | July 2025 | Slower recovery |
| Mariia | £15,551 | **NOT CLEARED** | £3,017 still outstanding |

**AR+NK started receiving 20% distributions from April 2025** (when AS's settlement cleared).

## Contractual Framework Summary

### Revenue Distribution (per Consultancy Agreements)

```
Gross Revenue (per advisor's clients)
  └─ Less: Shared Operational Expenses (HTL, 8x8, Salesforce, WorldCheck)
      └─ Net Revenue (100%)
          ├─ 70% → Advisor
          ├─ 10% → AS (platform override)
          └─ 20% → Waterfall Pool:
              ├─ First: That advisor's settlement
              ├─ Then: AS's £11,685 settlement (once, globally)
              └─ Then: AR+NK (tiered per revenue bands)
```

### Legitimate Shared Operational Expenses

Per the Consultancy Agreements, **only** the following are shared operational expenses:
- HTL (phones/IT support)
- 8x8 (communications)
- Salesforce (CRM)
- WorldCheck (AML screening)
- BCA/CBONDS (agreed later, 50/50 treatment)

**NOT shared:** BUPA, AXA, Netlify, Google Workspace, Website costs

---

## Actions Required

### Immediate

1. **Verify Cash Position**
   - Confirm £51,493 (or close to it) is available across Lloyds + Wise accounts
   - This represents AR+NK's accrued but unpaid entitlement

2. **Reconcile AS Overpayment**
   - Investigate the £2,950 variance between spreadsheet and bank payments
   - Determine if Oct-24 payment was legitimate pre-period settlement

### Short-Term

3. **Mariia Settlement Review**
   - Understand why her settlement is taking 13+ months to clear
   - Verify expense allocations against her revenue are correct
   - Consider whether operational expenses are being over-allocated

4. **Formalise AR+NK Distributions**
   - Establish process to actually PAY AR+NK their calculated entitlements
   - Monthly or quarterly payment cycle recommended

### Medium-Term

5. **Expense Classification Documentation**
   - Formally document which expenses are "shared" vs "individual"
   - Amend operating procedures to reflect contractual terms
   - Consider written agreement on BCA/CBONDS treatment

6. **8x8 Denominator Issue**
   - The inclusion of AR+NK in the 8x8 cost denominator was not agreed in writing
   - Formalise or correct this allocation

---

## Conclusion

**Good News:** There is no evidence of fraudulent calculation in AS's spreadsheet. The waterfall methodology is broadly correct, and the spreadsheet actually shows MORE owed to AR+NK than an independent model calculation.

**Bad News:** AR+NK have simply not been paid what they're owed. £51,493.23 should be sitting in company accounts, earmarked for AR+NK but never distributed.

**Characterisation:** This is a **governance/operational failure**, not fraud. The calculations are being done; the payments are not being made.

**Remedy:** Straightforward – pay what's owed.
