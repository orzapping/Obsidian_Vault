Specifically, the transfer of 90.1% of shares held by eFinn Global Limited (**eFinn**) to Interstellar Markets Group Ltd (**Interstellar**), bringing Interstellar's total shareholding to 100%, with Mr Xu Bugai as the Ultimate Beneficial Owner.

## 2. CURRENT OPERATIONAL STATUS AND TRANSITION PERIOD

### 2.1 The Transition Period - Timeline and Rationale

**September 2024 - Transition Commenced**

In September 2024, OGM's previous technology platform provider formally notified the Firm that they would be discontinuing their service. This platform was integral to OGM's trading operations, providing the interface between clients, the Firm, and liquidity providers.

Faced with the imminent loss of critical infrastructure, OGM's management made the prudent decision to suspend client trading immediately rather than risk:
- Operational failures during platform degradation
- Compromised service quality affecting client outcomes
- Potential regulatory breaches due to system instability
- Reputational damage from poor client experience

This was a risk management decision prioritizing client protection and regulatory compliance over short-term revenue generation.

**September 2024 - October 2025: Platform Migration**

During these 13 months, OGM undertook a comprehensive platform migration involving:

1. **Technology Infrastructure Upgrade:**
   - Selection and integration of new trading platform (MTrade)
   - Complete system architecture review and enhancement
   - User interface redesign for improved client experience
   - Enhanced performance capabilities and scalability

2. **Liquidity Provider Integration:**
   - Onboarding of new liquidity providers
   - Testing of straight-through-processing systems
   - Validation of matched-principal execution model
   - Establishment of robust backup liquidity arrangements

3. **Regulatory Reporting Integration:**
   - Full EMIR reporting capability implementation
   - MiFIR transaction reporting integration
   - Testing and validation of all regulatory submissions
   - Compliance with all data standards and technical specifications

4. **Compliance and Risk Framework Review:**
   - Updated policies and procedures for the new platform
   - Enhanced monitoring and surveillance capabilities
   - Refined client onboarding and appropriateness assessments
   - Strengthened financial crime controls

5. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Soft launch with test accounts
   - Live test trading with select clients
   - Comprehensive stress testing of all systems
   - Validation of disaster recovery and business continuity procedures

**September/October 2025 - Transition Completed**

By the end of September/early October 2025, all platform migration work was completed. OGM is now fully operational with:
- The new trading platform is fully functional and tested
- All liquidity providers are integrated and operational
- Regulatory reporting systems validated and operational
- Enhanced compliance monitoring in place
- All client accounts migrated and ready to trade

**Current Status: November 2025**

OGM is operationally ready to resume client trading. All infrastructure is in place, tested, and compliant. However, the Firm has not yet resumed active client trading as management awaited clarity on the ownership structure before restarting operations.

The decision to await completion of the change in control before resuming trading reflects:
- Prudent governance and planning
- Ensuring adequate capital backing is in place for restart and growth
- Alignment of ownership structure with operational strategy
- Commitment to orderly and well-capitalized restart

### 2.2 Client Base During Transition

**Pre-Transition Client Base**
At the commencement of the transition period (September 2024), OGM had:
- 32 retail clients
- 14 professional clients
- **Total: 46 clients**

**Client Management During Transition**
During the transition period:
- All clients were notified of the platform migration and temporary suspension of trading
- Client accounts and positions were properly managed and closed out
- No new client onboarding occurred
- Client relationships were maintained through regular communication
- Clients were kept informed of progress and the expected timeline

**Current Client Status (November 2025)**
As of November 2025, OGM maintains relationships with its 46 existing clients, all of whom have been kept informed of the platform upgrade and are aware of the pending change in control. Management has maintained regular contact with these clients and expects:
- Strong retention rate upon resumption of trading (estimated 75-80%)
- Clients are sophisticated and understand the rationale for the transition
- Many clients have expressed continued interest in trading with OGM once operations resume
- Enhanced platform provides improved functionality that should increase engagement

The 46 existing clients represent a valuable foundation for the restart, with established relationships, completed KYC/appropriateness assessments, and familiarity with OGM's service model.

### 2.3 Financial Position During Transition

**Revenue and Expenses**
During the 13-month non-trading period, OGM:
- **Revenue:** Generated zero trading revenue (no client activity)
- **Expenses:** Maintained minimal operational costs through cost reduction measures, reduced staffing to essential personnel only, maintained minimum regulatory obligations, and continued to meet all regulatory capital requirements.

**Share Purchase Agreement - Expense Reimbursement Arrangement**
In November 2024, a Share Purchase Agreement (SPA) was executed between eFinn Global Limited (seller) and Interstellar Markets Group Ltd (buyer). A key provision was that the buyer would reimburse OGM for all operational expenses incurred during the interim period.

**Interim Period Funding (November 2024 - October 2025):**
During the 12-month interim period, OGM incurred approximately **£500,000** in operational expenses. These covered essential salaries, regulatory costs, platform migration, office rent, and professional fees.

Under the SPA terms, Mr Xu Bugai reimbursed these expenses monthly. This enabled OGM to:
- Maintain full regulatory compliance
- Retain the experienced management team
- Complete the platform migration
- Meet all threshold conditions continuously with no breaches
- Maintain adequate regulatory capital at all times

**Accounting Treatment:**
The £500,000 reimbursement is recorded as **Other Income** in the profit and loss account, consistent with UK GAAP.

**Cash Position (November 2025):**
- Cash in OGM: **£460,000**
- Outstanding receivables from SPA: **£0**
- Current capitalization: **£534,000**
- No debt obligations

**Regulatory Capital Compliance:**
Throughout the 12-month interim period, regulatory capital requirements were continuously met, and no breaches of threshold conditions occurred.

**Significance for Change in Control Assessment:**
This arrangement provides evidence of:
1. **Financial Capability:** Capacity to fund post-acquisition commitments.
2. **Regulatory Understanding:** Recognizing the cost of maintaining a regulated firm.
3. **Long-Term Commitment:** Not a speculative investment.
4. **Track Record:** Proven reliability in meeting financial obligations.
5. **Threshold Conditions:** Maintained without interruption.

### 2.4 Why Change in Control Now

1. **Completion of Transition:** The platform migration is complete; OGM is ready to resume trading.
2. **Capital Requirements:** Restarting requires significant capital (£1.2M immediate injection) for a strong balance sheet and 3-5 year stability.
