## Executive Summary

**PRISM** (Prudential Risk Intelligence & Strategic Management) is a comprehensive regulatory capital management platform designed to automate the ICARA/MiFIDPRU process for UK investment firms.

**The Opportunity**: There is currently NO technology solution for the ICARA process. Firms are using entirely manual processes involving hundreds of documents scattered across departments, taking months to complete. Even Big 4 consultants struggle with the complexity.

**The Vision**: PRISM is not just a compliance tool - it's an operational intelligence platform that happens to satisfy regulatory requirements. The compliance functionality is the "trojan horse" that gets PRISM into firms; the real value is the proprietary data platform built on top.

**First Mover Advantage**: First to market will own the market. No known competitors as of mid-2025.

## Market Opportunity

### Primary Market: MiFID-Regulated Firms

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current UK MiFID-regulated firms | ~4,500 |
| Projected (5-year horizon) | ~7,000 |
| Annual growth rate | ~9% |

**Firm Types Included**:
- Investment banks
- Broker-dealers
- High-frequency trading firms
- Fund managers (discretionary and advisory)
- Insurance firms (investment activities)
- Payment services firms
- Wealth managers
- Corporate finance advisors

### Secondary Market: Service Providers

| Segment | Estimated Size |
|---------|----------------|
| Accounting/audit firms | ~2,000 |
| Compliance consulting firms | ~2,500 |
| Regulatory law firms | ~500+ |
| **Total Secondary** | **~5,000** |

These firms would use PRISM to serve their own clients - the regulated firms.

### Total Addressable Market

**10,000+ potential customers** in the UK alone.

## Target Customer

### Primary Persona: The CFO's Office

> **Critical Insight**: ICARA/MiFIDPRU is NOT a compliance function. It is owned and driven by the CFO's desk.

**Why CFO, Not Compliance?**

| ICARA/MiFIDPRU Is | Compliance Is |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Prudential capital regulation | Ensuring processes are followed |
| Finance and risk oriented | Procedural oversight |
| Requires financial expertise | Administrative in nature |
| Drives business decisions | Reports on adherence |

The compliance function's only touchpoint with ICARA is ensuring the process is actually undertaken - they lack the skill to execute the process itself. ICARA is fundamentally a **finance, capital, and risk** exercise.

### Decision Maker Profile

- **Title**: CFO, Finance Director, Head of Finance
- **Pain**: Spending months on manual ICARA process
- **Motivation**: Reduce time, improve accuracy, demonstrate proper compliance
- **Budget Authority**: Yes
- **Technical Sophistication**: Moderate (expects professional software)

### Secondary Personas

- **SMF Owners**: Senior Management Function holders with regulatory accountability
- **Risk Officers**: Need capital and risk metrics for decision-making
- **Consultants**: Need efficient tooling to serve multiple clients

---

## The Pain Point

### Current State: Manual Chaos

> "It's an unmitigated mess."

The ICARA process today is:

- **Entirely manual** - no technology solution exists
- **Document chaos** - hundreds of PDFs, XLS files, CSVs scattered across all departments
- **Time-consuming** - takes several months to complete
- **Spiralling coordination** - information requests flying around the firm
- **CFO's burden** - the CFO's desk tries to tie it all together at the end
- **Inaccurate** - manual processes introduce errors
- **Non-compliant** - firms are NOT implementing ICARA as a "living, breathing document" as required

### Evidence of Market Failure

- **Big 4 Struggles**: Even Deloitte and second-tier consulting firms have been "completely bamboozled" by the ICARA process
- **First-Hand Experience**: Founder has witnessed the state of ICARA implementation at multiple firms - it is absolutely NOT being done properly, if at all
- **Regulatory Gap**: The regulation requires ICARA to be a living document informing daily operations, but everyone treats it as an annual fire drill

### The Cost of the Status Quo

| Impact | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Time** | Months of senior staff time diverted to ICARA |
| **Accuracy** | Manual processes = errors in capital calculations |
| **Compliance Risk** | Not implementing ICARA properly = regulatory breach |
| **Opportunity Cost** | CFO's office distracted from strategic work |
| **Audit Risk** | Scattered documentation = audit nightmares |

---

## Solution Vision

### What PRISM Delivers

**One sentence**: PRISM reduces the ICARA process from months to days while dramatically improving data quality.

### Core Capabilities (V1)

1. **Complete ICARA Process Automation**
   - All regulatory calculations in one platform
   - Integrated data flows between components
   - Real-time calculation updates

2. **Regulatory Calculators**
   - FOR (Fixed Overhead Requirement)
   - KFR (K-Factor Requirement) - all 9 K-factors
   - OFAR (Overall Financial Adequacy Rule) - master aggregation
   - Risk Assessment with Monte Carlo simulation
   - Wind-Down Assessment

3. **Stress Testing (As Per Regulations)**
   - Linear stress testing
   - Reverse stress testing
   - Firm-specific variables, not generic inputs

4. **ICARA Document Generation**
   - Comprehensive, correct, high-quality output
   - PDF export
   - Visual charts, metrics, data points

5. **Living Document Functionality**
   - Daily operational use, not just annual compliance
   - Real-time dashboards for CFO
   - Continuous metrics for board reporting

### The Transformation

| Before PRISM | After PRISM |
|--------------|-------------|
| Months to complete | Days to complete |
| Hundreds of scattered documents | Single integrated platform |
| Manual calculations | Automated, real-time |
| Annual fire drill | Daily operational intelligence |
| Generic stress tests | Firm-specific, ICARA-variable stress tests |
| Audit nightmare | Complete audit trail |

## The Moat Strategy

### The Two-Tier Approach

> "If we just fulfil the regulatory requirement, PRISM becomes infinitely replicable over time and its inherent value will be firmly on a trajectory to zero as it gets copied."

**Tier 1: The Trojan Horse**
- Regulatory compliance functionality
- Gets PRISM into 10,000+ firms
- The "door opener"

**Tier 2: The Real Value**
- Proprietary data platform
- Network effects
- Impossible to replicate

### The Stress Testing Innovation

Traditional stress tests use generic variables (standard deviations, market scenarios). PRISM uses **ICARA-specific variables**:

- Actual K-factor values as inputs
- Real own funds positions
- Firm-specific wind-down costs
- Historical calculation trends

This produces outputs that actually **mean something** to the CFO - not abstract statistical exercises.

### The Data Endgame

> "Quantum Liquidity Systems Ltd becomes the owner of a database that'd make Bloomberg blush."

Over time, PRISM accumulates:
1. **Firm-level historical data** - every ICARA calculation, every stress test
2. **Cross-firm patterns** - anonymised but immensely valuable
3. **Market intelligence** - how is capital allocation shifting across the industry?
4. **Predictive models** - trained on real data, not theoretical models

This data is **proprietary** and **irreplicable**. A competitor can copy the ICARA calculations, but they cannot copy the accumulated data.

## Commercial Model

### Delivery

**SaaS** (Software as a Service)
- Cloud-hosted
- Multi-tenant architecture (organizationId-based isolation)
- Subscription model

### Pricing Strategy

| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Base unit | Per user |
| Initial price point | £99/user/month |
| Minimum seats | 3 (admin, SMF owner, key contributors) |
| Scaling | Price increases as value proves out |

### Pricing Philosophy

> "Rather have customers clamouring for access than delivering shit that doesn't work."

- **Quality-first**: Perfect accuracy before scale
- **Scarcity-driven**: Limit demand by price if necessary
- **Premium positioning**: This is not a commodity tool
- **Value capture**: As users see value, they buy more seats; price per seat can increase

### Revenue Model

Initial state:
- 100 firms × 5 users × £99 = £49,500/month = £594,000/year

Growth state:
- 1,000 firms × 10 users × £150 = £1,500,000/month = £18,000,000/year

The secondary revenue from data products (benchmarking, analytics) is additive.

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Phase 1: Founder Network

The founder has direct connections to:
- Multiple regulated firms (owns two)
- Regulatory lawyers at major firms
- Compliance consultants
- Big accounting/audit firms

**Initial customers**: Firms the founder knows personally. Proof of concept built-in.

### Phase 2: FCA/PRA Engagement

- Access FCA Sandbox forum
- Introduce PRISM to regulators
- Position as market/industry standard
- Potential: Build component specifically for FCA/PRA use
- Outcome: Regulatory endorsement = massive GTM advantage

### Phase 3: Channel Partners

- Consulting firms use PRISM for their clients
- Accounting firms bundle with audit services
- Law firms recommend to regulated clients

### Phase 4: Direct Sales

- Outbound to CFOs at MiFID firms
- Industry events and conferences
- Content marketing (ICARA best practices)

---

## Exit Vision

### Structure

- **Entity**: Quantum Liquidity Systems Ltd
- **Ownership**: 100% founder-owned
- **Decision Authority**: Sole founder - no committees, no stakeholder management

### Exit Path

1. **Build the asset**: Complete V1, start accumulating data
2. **Prove the model**: Revenue, customer traction, data value
3. **Approach VCs**: Early-stage VC for growth funding
4. **Scale**: Build full tech company with proper team
5. **Founder role**: Lead for a few years, then hand over operational reins
6. **Maintain equity**: Stay as shareholder, not operator
7. **Move on**: Pursue other ventures

### What's Being Built

The founder is clear-eyed:

> "The database repository of proprietary data ownership is much more exciting than the trojan horse part of providing a solution to get the ICARA process done."

PRISM the tool is the means. The data platform is the end.

## Regulatory Context

### Where ICARA/MiFIDPRU Sits

ICARA (Internal Capital Adequacy and Risk Assessment) is the process. MiFIDPRU is the regulation.

**FCA Statutory Objectives**:
- Ensure relevant financial markets function well
- Secure appropriate consumer protection
- Protect and enhance UK financial system integrity

**PRA Statutory Objectives**:
- Promote safety and soundness of firms
- Minimise adverse impacts from firm failures

**FCA Principles for Business**:
- **Principle 4: Financial Prudence** - A firm must maintain adequate financial resources

ICARA/MiFIDPRU is the mechanism by which firms demonstrate compliance with Principle 4.

### The Living Document Requirement

The regulations explicitly require ICARA to be:
- A living, breathing document
- Updated continuously, not just annually
- Used to inform daily operational decisions
- Reviewed at board level

**This is NOT being done**. Firms treat it as annual compliance.

PRISM enables proper implementation of this requirement for the first time.
