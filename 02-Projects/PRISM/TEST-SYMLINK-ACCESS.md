# Testing Symlink Access

## Direct Links to GOLDEN-SOURCE Files

Let's test if these links work:

1. Master Reference: [[GOLDEN-SOURCE/02-DOCUMENTATION/PRISM_MASTER_REFERENCE]]
2. MCP Guide: [[GOLDEN-SOURCE/02-DOCUMENTATION/MCP_COMPLETE_GUIDE]]
3. Reorganization Plan: [[GOLDEN-SOURCE/02-DOCUMENTATION/PRISM_REORGANIZATION_PLAN]]

## Calculator Documentation
- [[GOLDEN-SOURCE/02-DOCUMENTATION/calculator documentation/kaum-documentation]]
- [[GOLDEN-SOURCE/02-DOCUMENTATION/calculator documentation/kcmh-documentation]]
- [[GOLDEN-SOURCE/02-DOCUMENTATION/calculator documentation/kasa-feature-user-documentation]]

## If links don't work, we'll need to:
1. Either copy files instead of symlinking
2. Or adjust Obsidian settings to follow symlinks
3. Or create a different linking structure
