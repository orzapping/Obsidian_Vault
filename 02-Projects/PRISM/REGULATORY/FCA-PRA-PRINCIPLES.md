## Principle 4: Financial Prudence

> **"A firm must maintain adequate financial resources."**

### What This Means

Firms must:
- Hold sufficient capital to absorb losses
- Maintain liquidity to meet obligations
- Plan for orderly wind-down
- Withstand stress scenarios

### How ICARA/MiFIDPRU Implements Principle 4

| ICARA Component | How It Implements Principle 4 |
|-----------------|------------------------------|
| OFR (Own Funds Requirement) | Minimum capital based on activities |
| OFTR (Threshold Requirement) | Additional capital for stress/wind-down |
| K-Factors | Risk-based capital for specific activities |
| Wind-Down Assessment | Planning for orderly closure |
| Stress Testing | Resilience under adverse conditions |

### The PRISM Connection

PRISM enables firms to:
1. **Calculate** their regulatory capital requirements accurately
2. **Monitor** their capital position continuously
3. **Demonstrate** compliance with Principle 4
4. **Plan** for stress scenarios and wind-down

---

## Why This Context Matters

Understanding that ICARA/MiFIDPRU sits under Principle 4 - Financial Prudence - frames the entire exercise:

1. **Not just compliance**: It's about genuine financial resilience
2. **Public interest**: Protects clients, markets, and the financial system
3. **Firm interest**: Ensures the firm can weather storms and wind down orderly
4. **Regulatory expectation**: Firms must genuinely assess and manage capital adequacy

### The Gap PRISM Fills

Current market reality:
- Firms treat ICARA as annual compliance exercise
- Manual processes don't enable continuous monitoring
- Principle 4 spirit is not being met

PRISM enables:
- Genuine living document implementation
- Daily capital monitoring
- Real compliance with Principle 4's intent
