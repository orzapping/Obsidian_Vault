Both now have secondary objectives to boost competition and the UK's economic competitiveness, balancing robust regulation with growth, notes [the Bank of England](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation/secondary-competition-objective) and the UK Parliament. 

PRA Statutory Objectives

- **Primary (General):** Promote the safety and soundness of PRA-authorised firms, minimizing adverse impacts on UK financial stability from firm failures.
- **Primary (Insurers):** Protect insurance policyholders.
- **Secondary (Competition):** Facilitate effective competition in markets for PRA-authorised firm services.
- **Secondary (Competitiveness & Growth):** Support the UK economy's international competitiveness and growth. 

FCA Statutory Objectives

- **Strategic:** Ensure relevant financial markets function well.
- **Operational:**
    - Secure appropriate consumer protection.
    - Protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system.
    - Promote effective competition in consumers' interests.
- **Secondary (Competitiveness & Growth):** Support the UK's competitiveness and growth (introduced by [the Financial Services and Markets Act 2023](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/29/part/1/chapter/3/crossheading/fca-and-pra-objectives-and-regulatory-principles) (FSMA 2023)).
