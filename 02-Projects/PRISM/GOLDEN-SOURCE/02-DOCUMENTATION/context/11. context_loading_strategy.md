# Context Loading Strategy Guide
## Efficient Context Window Management for PRISM Development

---

## Overview

This guide establishes an efficient context loading strategy to maximize development productivity while minimizing context window consumption. The strategy implements a tiered approach: Essential → Selective → Comprehensive.

**Problem Solved**: Prevents context window exhaustion during session initialization  
**Efficiency Gain**: 80% context reduction for routine development tasks  
**Implementation**: CLAUDE.md + selective file loading strategy

## 4. CONTEXT LOADING BEST PRACTICES

### **Session Initialization Workflow**

#### **Step 1: Assess Session Requirements**
```yaml
Questions to Ask:
- What type of development work is planned?
- Do I need comprehensive specifications?
- Am I working on integration between modules?
- Do I need to make strategic decisions?
- Am I troubleshooting complex issues?
```

#### **Step 2: Select Appropriate Context Tier**
```yaml
Decision Tree:
- Routine development → Tier 1 (Essential)
- New module start → Tier 1 + Master Context
- Integration work → Tier 1 + Integration Guide
- Strategic planning → Tier 1 + Strategic Framework
- Major issues → Tier 1 + Relevant specifics
```

#### **Step 3: Load Context Efficiently**
```yaml
Loading Strategy:
- Start with essential context
- Add specific files as needed
- Avoid loading everything "just in case"
- Monitor context window usage
- Optimize based on actual needs
```

### **Context Window Monitoring**

#### **Usage Guidelines**
```yaml
Context Window Allocation:
- Context Loading: 20-30% maximum
- Development Work: 60-70% minimum
- Response Generation: 10-20% buffer

Warning Signs:
- Context loading >40% of window
- Limited working space for development
- Frequent context truncation
- Slow session initialization
```

#### **Optimization Techniques**
```yaml
Efficiency Strategies:
- Use CLAUDE.md for 90% of sessions
- Load additional files only when needed
- Avoid comprehensive context for routine work
- Monitor and adjust based on productivity
- Regular context strategy reviews
```
