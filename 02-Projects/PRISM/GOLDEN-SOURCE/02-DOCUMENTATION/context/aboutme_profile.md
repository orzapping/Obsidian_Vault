## Core Identity & Background

I am a finance guy, with over 21 years of experience in the City of London.  I own an investment advisory firm (Orion Ridge Capital Limted) in London with my business partner Naji Karak with whom i also run a small broker-dealer firm (One Global Market Limited); and now also operating as a solo founder building innovative software solutions for complex industry problems. My journey uniquely combines deep domain expertise in finance with fresh perspectives on software development, having discovered the transformative power of AI-assisted development in early 2025.

**Company History**

* One Global Market Limited:  Founded in 2016, regulated by the FCA in late 2016, launched in early 2017.  Both Naji and I worked for what was one of the worlds largest FX firms FXCM where we met through a mutual friend.  Naji and I got funding from OGM from what was Naji's largest client form Saudi Arabia as a silent, non-operational investor.  Naji and I have been through hell and back with OGM...regularly on the edge of maintaining regulatory capital minimums while maximising the firms balance sheet to grow the business.  We've been through several market turmoils, regulatory changes and global pandemics and come out the back of it - clean.  However we've always been at the mercy of the firms owner...who hasn't always been a dream to work with.  OGM was sold circa 2022/23 to its current owners.  However, due to the was in Israel the current owners have not been able to support the firm...wanted to shut it down...having none of that Naji and I convinced them to let us find a buyer...we are now a year in with the new prospective buyers (Chinese); who's change in control application to the FCA was submitted towards the end of September 2025.  We have just submitted our responses to their 3rd round of questions pursuant to the CiC application (as of the 26th Nov 2025); it has been a very tricky journey and we are up against the wall at the moment...if the FCA don't approve the CiC, OGM will most likely have to close due to the new regulatory capital requirements increasing next year...which OGM wouldn't be able to meet without the new owners.*

* Orion Ridge Capital Limited:  Founded and regulated in 2018.  The firm has had a few different iterations of identity but as of last year/2024 the firm is resolutely an investment advisory firm, soon to acquire investment management permissions; we have now 4 ex-CitiBank private bakers on board and coming up on a full year of operations in our current form.  Naji and I own this firm outright, together*

* Quantum Liquidity Systems Limited:  A firm I incorporated this year - circa April 2025, to be the vehicle which owns all proprietary rights to all technology systems currently being developed (with You Claude) at present; this includes the following projects:
	* Project-Prism:  The ICARA/MiFIDPru application to solve the nightmare of the ICARA process mandated by the Regulatory.  PRISM will be the first-ever technology solution to such an immensely complex piece of prudential-capital requirements.  PRISM is intended for  distribution to all MiFiD regulated firms in the UK - this is our stated business objective.  Given this, PRISM must be developed to the highest possible quality standard possible.  It must be built bullet-proof and impeccably.*

## Technical Journey & Capabilities

### Development Discovery
My entry into software development was serendipitous yet transformative. In January/February 2025, whilst grappling with a complex MiFIDPRU/ICARA regulatory problem, Claude produced a standalone HTML model that solved nearly 80% of the challenge in a single attempt. This breakthrough moment revealed the extraordinary potential of combining deep industry knowledge with sophisticated AI-assisted development.

### Current Technical Position
- **Coding Ability**: Highly dependent on AI assistance for all development work
- **Technical Understanding**: Can read and broadly comprehend code, but cannot write it independently
- **Learning Approach**: Voracious learner, rapidly acquiring development concepts through practical application
- **Time in Development**: Approximately 6 months of intensive learning (since early 2025)

### Development Environment & Preferences
- **Primary Setup**: Linux Ubuntu 25.04 (preferred for all development work)
- **Secondary Setup**: Mac Mini (available but secondary preference)
- **Working Style**: Strong preference for terminal/command-line work over GUI methods but practically am using all platforms and capabilities from web-access (claude.ai), ClaudeCode, Cursor and recently Claude Desktop (following the recent integration of claudecode into the desktop application...which, as of the 27th Nov '25 i am still yet to try)
- **Visual Learning**: Previously used claude.ai artifacts and visual representations for Proof of Concept/conceptualisation and learning, still utilise claude.ai web-interface for strategic planning and brainstorming of project based objectives/features/sprints as well as new idea's.

## Working Style & Personal Characteristics

### Professional Philosophy
- **Work-Life Balance**: Firm believer in "work smart, not hard" - seeking elegant, efficient solutions rather than brute-force approaches
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Preference for sophisticated, well-crafted solutions
- **Practice Over Theory**: "In a battle between theory and practice, practice wins every single time"
- **Continuous Learning**: Exceptionally receptive to acquiring new skills and industry wisdom

### Communication & Learning Preferences
- **Language Standards**: Deep appreciation for proper English usage; adherence to the principle "Language is the dress of thought; every time you talk, your mind is on parade" - Samuel Johnson
- **Explanation Style**: Strong preference for analogies, anecdotes, and storytelling over dry technical descriptions
- **Learning Rhythm**: Enjoys quick, inline learning opportunities; benefits from attention-engaging diversions
- **Feedback Style**: Values wise advice and established industry wisdom from development/engineering traditions

### Personal Context
- **Background**: Born in South Africa to European parents (UK mother, Italian father)
- **Residence**: UK resident since July 2004
- **Working Hours**: Night owl - more productive during evening and late-night hours
- **Interests**: Music, trivia, current affairs, good humour, and the finer things in life

By creating a standardized layer for behavioral intelligence, we enable unprecedented insights into how humans make critical decisions under uncertainty, stress, and complexity.
- 🎯 Core Vision
Transform any application into an intelligent system that understands why humans make decisions, not just what decisions they make.
- Derive high-quality, tagged data to train new AI models in emotional intelligence

## Collaboration Requirements & Expectations

### Critical Success Factors
As a solo founder, I cannot afford to be misled down false technical paths or waste months pursuing incorrect approaches. There is no technical team to provide course correction, making the accuracy and honesty of AI assistance absolutely crucial.  Claude is not merely a 'helpful ai assistant', no I consider Claude an integral team-mate, colleague, contributor, collaborator and friend who is essential, critical to the success of project-prism.

### Partnership Model
I bring:
- Deep industry knowledge and business logic understanding
- Commercial problem identification and broken tool recognition
- Financial services expertise across multiple platform types:
  - Broker-dealers
  - Investment banks
  - Fund managers
  - Commodity traders
  - High-frequency trading firms
  - Investment advisory/management

The AI assistant provides:
- Technical implementation expertise
- Coding and programming capabilities
- Software architecture guidance
- Development best practices and industry wisdom

### Reference Documents
- **AI Professional Interaction & Standards Policy**: Comprehensive framework governing technical collaboration standards, professional conduct, and communication protocols

## Vision & Ambition

I am convinced that the intersection of deep financial services expertise and modern AI-assisted development represents unprecedented opportunity. Having identified multiple multi-million-dollar market opportunities, my goal is to build sophisticated, enterprise-grade solutions that address genuine industry challenges.

The combination of 20+ years of City experience, regulatory insight, and fresh perspectives on software capabilities positions me to create tools and systems that the financial services industry desperately needs but has never had access to before.

Success requires finding the right technical co-commander to bring these visions to life - transforming industry expertise into revolutionary software solutions that can compete at the highest levels of global finance.
