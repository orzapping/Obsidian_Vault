Organisation and Workflow Reorganisation Plan

Critical considerations and context:

* 1. currenlty using both macmini and linux machines / next to one another,  connected via input leap but no interconnected server/file sharing capacity.  This needs to change,
i need both, i use both but having two separate file systems is not efficient. I currently have to use localsend to tx files between the two machines - this is ridiculous given i have such a sophisticated setup techncially but dont have effective filesharing.  lets set this up properly and permanently between the two machines.

* 2. i have a lot of work/project related documentation across both machines. i need to consolidate this material into a single location / source of truth.  and then, when i work,
these files and folders need to be the golden source repository.  from there, relevant files can then be moved into relevant project directories/folders.  we need to set this up accordingly.

* 3. Project folders/directories / repo's and branches:  I need a comprehensive and practical organisation of all these directories/files/folders/repo's and branches - both on my machines and in the cloud/GH.  I am relatively new to this dev stuff and have never been the greatest when it comes tgo admin-organising..but if i get s sytem down and it works for me, i stick to it and its perfect.  but if i have an admin/organisation mess in which im operating then i tend to just avoid it altogether.  this is no good, i need to have an environment in which i feel organised and in control so i dont need to hesitate of ponder how to orchestrate my work -whether that be straight production dev, or experimentation/prototyping etc.  So, i need help to design  a system and organisation environment which have the following charactgeristics:
* - a safe main branch and corresponding local directory/folder structure
* - a practical and comprehensive organisation of all project directories/files/folders/repo's and branches - both on my machines and in the cloud/GH.
* - a clear and practical system for creating an experimental/prototyping/sandbox branch and corresponding local directory/folder structure.

* 4. Proof of concept/prototypes - currenlty, the core html calculators can be found in the project directory/folder.  i have recently created another 4 modules which have been approved to move into production dev.  these calcs and their respective documentation are currently on the mac - i am going to copy these over for quick access and sorting but thereafter i want to consolidate all the POC html prototype calculators into a clear and comprehensive fodler within the main project branch both locally and on the GH repo.
  
* 5.  Experimentation sandbox:  we need to design a system/environment for creating an experimental/prototyping/sandbox branch and corresponding local directory/folder structure.  this should be a safe and practical environment for me to experiment with new ideas, concepts, and approaches to the project.  it should be a place where i can try out new things, make mistakes, and learn from them without affecting the main project.  it should be a place where i can be creative and explore new possibilities.  it should be a place where i can be productive and efficient.
