alrigtht gemini, tonight we have a complex research and planning session ahead of us.  I have the initial framework for a new project - Project Theta, here is a synopsis:  Project Theta is a systematic options trading dashboard and signal generation system focused on **selling volatility premium** through defined-risk strategies (iron condors, strangles, credit spreads). The system identifies elevated implied volatility environments, generates entry signals based on configurable rules, tracks positions with aggregated Greeks, and monitors performance.

**Core Philosophy:** Volatility is the one true mean-reverting asset class. Implied volatility consistently exceeds realised volatility due to the variance risk premium (insurance demand). We systematically harvest this premium while managing tail risk through defined-risk structures and disciplined position sizing..  Here is the obsidian vault directory with all the project setup and dev commencement prompts/context and references scheduled:  /run/user/1000/doc/18952363/Obsidian-Vault/02-Projects/Project-Theta/project-theta-setup-files.  this project includes references of other similar and related GH repo's.  the idea being simply not to reinvent the wheel AND to incorporate already developed high quality code, features and components and idea's.  the objective tonight is i want you to do a thorough review of this project with a view to looking for clear enhancement opportunities, highly sophisticated additional features/components/modules/algorithms..whatever that may be, but to the end of using high quality existing stuff, harnessing the power of your super intelligence and build something even more incredible - a highly sophisticated options trading dashboard, with all the possible bells and whistles that your ultra sophisticated super intelligence can derive from your vast web of super intelligence.  I want you to think of this exercise as though this is destined to be Your options trading platform from which you will identify and capture real alpha.  the highest possible quality of sophisticated meaningful data enabling smart trade identification; then order management; risk managements, and PnL managements, stats, data, metrics and ratio's.  this platform must include highly sophisticated but slick UI, visuals, graphs, charts - the whole nine yards.  THIS is your quant trading hedge fund,  you will not use or develop anything except the absolute cutting bleeding edge of whats possible technologically, right now and for the next 5 years!  this is your mandate,  this is your opportunity to outclass every existing variation of technology around this theme.  but we're making it REAL.  review the framework and files, understand your environment and mandate, synthesis a comprehensive and detailed research report fulfilling these objectives.

For reference, here is a list of repo's we are pulling quality reference code/features/modules/idea's from:
