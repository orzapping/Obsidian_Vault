**Aleah,** 


Ground Rules for Going Out:


1. Parental Supervision: known/confirmed Parental Supervision - at all times
2. Location(s): Exact address/location must be known fully
3. Time(s):  exact times you will be there until

  

Conditions:

  

1. Parental Supervision:  We must know who this/these parents are, and have an open line of communication with them for the full duration you intend/expect to be out with them.  You/your friends Must remain under their supervision, at all times.
2. Locations:  You are legally not permitted into many/most venues because of your age.  Therefore you are not permitted to go to these places unless it has been strictly and specifically designated for young people with all necessary adult supervision and venue security.  The world is a dangerous place and you are 13. You are not old enough, nor do you have enough experience to reliably keep yourself out of danger.  We are your parents, that is our primary job, and we will do it to protect you, because we love you dearly and dont want any harm to come to you ever.  Please recognise we dont want to stop you having fun.  We want, and will, prevent you from exposing yourself to dangerous people, dangerous situations or circumstances.
3. Time:  this needs to be defined in absolute terms.  There is always a hard limit/curfew to how long you may be permitted to be out.  Break this rule and your time allowance will drop to Zero.

  

How to use these rules?

  

Aleah, this is simple.  If you want to go out somewhere, you need to gather all the information necessary to prove to us you have adhered to the 3 Ground Rules.  These are the MINIMUM requirements and information we need BEFORE we can even consider whether you are permitted to attend the event.  If you do not have all 3 lined up, ready and organised, you dont have enough information to even ask if you can attend.  Organise, collect the information and data, and then come to ask and Ask, politely if you can attend.  We will only make a decision once all 3 Rules have been met.  Meeting all 3 Rules does NOT necessarily mean we will say yes.  We, as your parents will assess the quality of your information, verify its authenticity and accurateness (including contacting the supervising parents/adults to explicitly CONFIRM ALL 3 points/rules).  If, and only if, we are satisfied and comfortable that your desire to go out is safe and secure and that we can confirm your safety at any and all times while you’re out, then we may permit you to attend.

  

Notes on doing this properly…

  

Aleah, it is your responsibility and duty as our daughter and as a human being, to take responsibility for yourself, to respect your parents and to be an honest and wholesome person.  If you lie or deceive us, apart from the massive heartbreaking disappointment we will feel, you will also prove to us that you are not responsible enough to be permitted to go out at all.  Remember Aleah, you have already betrayed our trust on this before.  

  

Like I said to you a few months back, you should really work on being a Leader-friend.  And less of the follower-friend.  Lead by example, show your friends that you are the responsible, grown up, smart and intelligent one.  Your life will improve in all aspects if you do this.  Work on it, trust me.  
  
Final thoughts…

  

Aleah, I know you were given enough time and opportunity to get organised about what the plans, if any, were for NYE.  It seems you havent done this. You cannot expect us to grant you permission to go out into the dark night on NY eve without any clue or details about where you will be, who you will be with and whether you will be and remain safe.  None of this lines up with you being able to go out.  You haven’t done your part, so we cant do ours.  It works both ways - give, and take.  If you want to go out, you now have the rules written down, codified in black and white, forever.  These are the Rules. They are permanent.  They will not change.  
  
adopt them, implement them effectively and you’ll get to go and do the things you want to do.  If you dont, we as your parents Do Not consent to you going out. Anywhere.  

  

You are 13 my girl…you couldnt be more vulnerable if we painted the words on your face Aleah.  Understand we will not allow you to put yourself, or be put by some else, at risk of any sort.

  

There is nothing more to it than that Aleah.

  

I love you, always my darling daughter.  You know that.  I cannot bear the thought of any danger or harm coming to you, ever.  I would rather you hate me, and you be safe, than any alternative Aleah.  I know you understand that.
