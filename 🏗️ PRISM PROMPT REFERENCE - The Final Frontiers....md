## 📍 PREMISE & OBJECTIVE

The premise of this document is to frame and contextualise 2 things:

1. the current project-prism status
2. formulate a strategy & planning basis upon which we proceed to the final stages of project-prism development

*Objective of this meme/prompt:

* to embed all necessary context needed for project prism: to enable effective prompt engineering and coordination*
* collate, generate all necessary supporting/contextual documentation to enable CC to commence with further development in project-prism

## 📂 HISTORY & BACKGROUND

* PP originated earlier in 2025 (feb), born out of a problem i was having with the ICARA process for businesses I am personally involved in or have ownership in.
* 
* claude.ai was instrumental in giving rise to the possibility and opportunity to collaborate directly with ai-models to directly develop technology solutions for financial services company's, without having to engage specialist technology developers and thus dis-intermediating the translation layer and huge costs associated thereto.
* 
* Early stage planning and preparation involved creating most of the necessary components for PR, in proof-of-concept .html form, all of which can be found here:  [[/home/obsidan/Documents/Obsidian Vault/02-Projects/PRISM/GOLDEN-SOURCE/01-PROTOTYPES]]
* 
* Following the development and testing of all the essential modules, a plan to start implementing these into a proper React/TS app in order to enable this app to be distributed commercially (as a SaaS application) following completion.  It is important to note the intended objective for PP is for commercial sale to MiFiD permissioned financial services company's in the UK, as a comprehensive technology solution to undertake and fulfil all regulatory requirements and obligations for mifid regulated firm.
* 
* Following tech stack/architecture design and decision making, a comprehensive 'migration' plan was devised in order to migrate all proof of concept modules into the necessary tech stack architecture, which can be found here:  [[/home/obsidan/Documents/Obsidian Vault/02-Projects/PRISM/GOLDEN-SOURCE/02-DOCUMENTATION/context/1. migration-strategy.md]]

* As of nov/dec 2025 most of the core modules have been developed and implemented into the broader base application, which has functionality and is navigable.  There still remains 3-4 supporting modules requiring development but are to some degree or another conditional upon the core modules having been fully developed and implemented.  These remaining modules will be discussed in further detail below  [[/home/obsidan/Documents/Obsidian Vault/02-Projects/PRISM/GOLDEN-SOURCE/02-DOCUMENTATION/context/0. master_context_PRISM.md]]
* 
* A note on ai-model collaboration to date:  With this project having started in early 2025, and my close collaboration with ai in the development of this project, various models have been used to help inform and develop the project.  However, the vast majority of /dev  work has been undertaken in Claude Code, but early days included Claude through the web-interface spanning Sonnet 3.5, 3.7, 4.0 & 4.5, as well as Opus 3, 4, 4.1 and now 4.5.  Please see the following docs for essential context:  [[/home/obsidan/Documents/Obsidian Vault/02-Projects/PRISM/GOLDEN-SOURCE/02-DOCUMENTATION/context/aboutme_profile.md]]  


## 🧠 WHERE WE ARE NOW?

*  Majority of core modules developed, implemented and functional*
* approaching phase where we need to tie-in/route all constituent modules to function collectively to bring about the technology solution envisioned by this application.  This functionality will largely be illustrated from within the app via the 'Intelligence Dashboard' module which needs to be designed and developed.  In order to do this effectively a full and comprehensive understanding of the apps objectives, features and functionality/ies si absolutely essential - accordingly we will be working closely together to ensure every move made is correct, is functioning correctly and is fully appropriate.  Incremental testing is integral to this project, we do not proceed until all new and existing dev work, functionalities and features are 100% aligned and functional, both individually and collectively.


## 🔧 SO, WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?

*  Planning and preparation:  We need to fully ascertain and understand where we currently are; next*
	* design and implement proper routing between modules, ensuring they pull all relevant information and data from other modules as appropriate/needed
	* Database:  we need to carefully design the underlying database that will support the application.. AGAIN, this app is for commercial distribution so we need to to build this to be sufficiently robust and scaleable for its intended objectives and distribution.  Given this app will be distro'd to financial services firms, the database needs to be designed and implemented such that the app operates to enable firms to delegate multiple users, with varying degrees of read/write/edit/access; ensure all necessary record keeping and audit logs; ensure users can save their work individually under their user-account while maintaining the higher level, firm level database state.  A fully functioning version control and save-history states must be embedded into the database to ensure integrity of data, regulatory requirements around record keeping etc.  User accounts will be allocated according to seniority and SMF function whereby senior managers approve and underwrite downstream users work, such that owners have full oversight, control and responsibility for all work undertaken.
	* An essential part of the upcoming development and routing of modules into one another to extract and use data already calculated/computed in other modules, is to ensure the underlying database is properly built to support and enable this wide spread complexity of work required as part of the MiFIDPru/ICARA prudential capital regulatory process.
	* 
	* NOTE!  This application is intended for distribution to CFO's/Finance desk of mifid approved regulated firms.  The CFO owns the responsibility for the ICARA process - alone.  the Compliance dept are only contributors, not owners.  This app brings a technology solution that enables effective compliance with the mifidpru regulations - which are Prudential Capital requirements that dictate what a firms minimum capital requirement is, and why.  The processes mandated to ascertain this information and data is highly complex!  No technology solution currently exists in the market for the ICARA process, Project Prism will be the first of its kind and is intended to function as a crucial technology solution in mifid approved and regulated firm in the UK.  This app therefore needs to be developed to be bulletproof and painstakingly accurate and precise.  there is no room for errors or approximations - the rules are prescriptive, we are merely building all these rules into a technology solution.  whether it works or not is absolutely empirically determinable.

### DOCUMENTATION
Location: `/srv/prism-shared/GOLDEN-SOURCE/02-DOCUMENTATION/`

I need you Claude to have a full 30,000ft view of the app, its objectives, features and functionality...where we are, and why, and where we're going next.  The core calculation modules serve to enable firms to do the multitude of calculations necessary to calculate the firms minimum capital requirements and also fully understand the constituent components that drive that figure, maintain a historical record to show context (via historical data and reporting modules).  Once we have all the modules properly integrated and cross-routed across and between one another, we then need to design and construct the 'intelligence dashboard' which will pull data and stats from all the underlying modules, clearly show the minimum capital requirement as well as other various visuals, graphs, statistics, data, metrics and ratio's - to being the ICARA process into a consolidated clear, meaningful and instructive illustration of all calculations;  further informed by regulatolry prescribed linear and reverse stress testing and all the metrics/variables and data those simulations reveal and how to interpret them both at a daily operations level and at a Board level.  In addition to basic icara functionality and calculation, we are also building in various value-add features and functionalities as our proprietary moat and differentiating factor of this technology solution.

We therefore need to create or update various documents to facilitate the next stage of dev work, this includes:

1.  Claude.md - must be updated to fully reflect and define the full scope and applicability of the PP application so the ":WHY" behind every piece of dev work is fully and absolutely understood, both in the micro sense and the macro sense:  modules developed/implemented, how they integrate and work with one another; where and how modules must pull existing data or calculations from other modules so we arent reinventing the wheel for data/metrics/calculations that already exist.  This file needs to be updated after each new dev session to be a clear and up to date representation of where the project currently is, and whats next.
2. Design and develop all necessary CC prompts that will drive each new piece of dev work incrementally and chronologically.
3. Fully scope and document each modules for its features and functionalities such that each new piece of dev work can reference whats available and existing in other modules it can pull from, rather than reinventing the wheel.
4. DATABASE design: CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT - this needs to be done meticulously, painstakingly accurately such that no data is lost; users can iterate and save work according to their permissions and user profile; senior managers and owners of the icara process (FINANCE/CFO, not 'compliance') can review, edit accept and finalise reports, status etc.  This must align with the SMCR module where all regulatory functions are defined to each user and limited by their respective permissions.  historical snapshots must be a default feature whereby users/owners can review where the firm was at a past date; show and understand how the firms capital and risk positions have evolved over time and the impact on the ICARA process and the firms regulatory prudential and risk position.
