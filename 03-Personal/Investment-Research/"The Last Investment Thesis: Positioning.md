"The Last Investment Thesis: Positioning for an Unknowable Discontinuity"
Or: Why Your Portfolio Strategy is Fighting the Last War
Opening Salvo (Executive Summary)
The Comfortable Lie We Tell Ourselves:
Traditional investment analysis assumes continuity - that tomorrow will be a comprehensible iteration of today. We model discount rates, project cash flows, and debate whether the S&P will return 7% or 9% annually.
This is akin to debating optimal cavalry positions in 1913.
The Uncomfortable Truth:
We are experiencing a technological discontinuity that makes traditional valuation models not just wrong, but semantically meaningless. The advancement from GPT-3 to Claude Opus 4.1 in 24 months represents a rate of capability expansion that breaks our conceptual frameworks. We cannot price what we cannot comprehend, and we cannot comprehend what evolves faster than our ability to model it.
The Meta-Investment Thesis:
Stop trying to predict the unpredictable. Instead, construct anti-fragile positioning that benefits from the volatility of our collective inability to price the future.
Part I: The Velocity Problem
The Exponential Reality Check
January 2024: GPT-4 seems magical
January 2025: GPT-4 seems quaint
January 2026: [ERROR: PREDICTION IMPOSSIBLE]
The half-life of AI amazement is now approximately 6 months. By the time an investment committee approves an "AI strategy", the underlying assumptions are obsolete.
Case Study in Obsolescence:

Morgan Stanley's 2023 thesis: "AI will enhance analyst productivity by 30%"
Reality 2025: AI can replace the entire analyst function
Morgan Stanley's 2025 response: Still hiring analysts

This isn't adaptation; it's institutional psychosis.
Part II: The Valuation Impossibility
Traditional Metrics in an AI World:
P/E Ratios: What earnings multiple is appropriate for a company whose entire workforce might be automated within 5 years? Or one that might capture 90% of its market via AI dominance?
DCF Models: How do you discount cash flows when the discount rate assumes stable monetary policy, but AI-driven unemployment might force permanent ZIRP?
Book Value: What's the value of industrial plant when AI-designed factories make it obsolete? What's the value of office real estate when knowledge work happens in data centres?
The Paradox: The more precisely we model, the more precisely wrong we become.
Part III: The Portfolio Construction Revolution
Traditional Allocation (The Museum Piece):

60% Equities
40% Bonds
Rebalance annually
Retire at 65

The Discontinuity Portfolio:
Core Holdings (40%): "The Inevitables"

Infrastructure plays that survive all scenarios
Government bonds of nuclear powers
Physical commodities with extraction bottlenecks
Land in stable jurisdictions

Volatility Harvest (20%): "The Emotional Arbitrage"

Long vol structures before AI announcements
Short vol after panic selling
Pairs trading: AI winners vs losers
The spread between implied and realised will be extraordinary

Exponential Upside (20%): "The Lottery Tickets"

Deep OTM calls on disruption beneficiaries
Private markets/VC exposure to AI infrastructure
Moonshots that become mundane if AI succeeds

Civilisation Hedges (20%): "The Unthinkable Insurance"

Gold/Bitcoin (monetary system breakdown)
Defence contractors (social unrest)
Agricultural land (supply chain collapse)
Citizenship/residency arbitrage positions

Part IV: The Second-Order Wealth Strategies
Beyond Portfolio Theory:
Human Capital Arbitrage:

Your children learning Mandarin matters more than their inheritance
Network effects compound; investment returns might not
Skills that complement AI > Skills that compete with AI

Jurisdiction Arbitrage:

Multiple passports aren't paranoia; they're portfolio theory
Tax residency flexibility when wealth taxes arrive
Property rights in AI age uncertain everywhere

Social Capital Preservation:

Private club memberships (human networks will premiumise)
Art/collectibles (Veblen goods in post-scarcity world)
Education brand affiliations (signalling when ability becomes commoditised)
