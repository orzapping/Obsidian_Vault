The less obvious side of the AI play...

The Professional Services Massacre
The Audit/Accounting Oligopoly (PwC, EY, Deloitte, KPMG):
Their entire pyramid scheme of billing out graduates at £1,500/day whilst paying them £35k/year is about to implode. AI can already do 80% of junior audit work better than humans. However: they might actually make MORE money short-term as they:

Sell "AI transformation" consulting at premium rates
Maintain the same client fees whilst decimating junior headcount
Become tech companies with accounting licenses

Winners: The Big 4 who adapt fastest
Losers: Mid-tier firms (BDO, Grant Thornton) who lack scale to develop proprietary AI
The Financial Infrastructure Play
The Boring Infrastructure Companies:

Broadridge Financial - Processes 90% of US proxy votes, runs back-office for half of Wall Street
SS&C Technologies - Runs fund admin for $2 trillion in assets
FIS/Fiserv - Payment processing infrastructure

These unsexy bastards own the pipes. When every hedge fund starts using AI for trading, who processes the exponentially increasing transaction volume? When AI advisors manage retail portfolios, who handles the custody and settlement?
The Regulatory Compliance Gold Rush
AI will trigger the mother of all regulatory responses. Every model will need:

Audit trails
Bias testing
Explainability documentation
Version control
Decision lineage

Potential Winners:

Palantir - Already selling AI governance to governments
NICE Systems - Surveillance and compliance tech
Verint - Similar space, lower profile
RELX (owns LexisNexis) - Legal/regulatory data monopoly

The Energy/Infrastructure Angle
Here's what nobody's talking about: AI compute is going to absolutely brutalise power grids.
The Numbers:

Training GPT-4 used ~50 GWh of electricity
ChatGPT queries use 10x the energy of Google searches
Data centres already consume 2% of global electricity

The Play:

Uranium miners (Cameco, Kazatomprom) - Only nuclear can provide baseload for 24/7 AI compute
Cooling specialists (Vertiv, Carrier) - Every watt of compute needs cooling
Grid infrastructure (Quanta Services, MasTec) - Massive grid upgrades required
Industrial REITs near cheap power sources

The Casualty List (Short Candidates)
The Walking Dead:

Pearson/Educational Publishers - Why buy textbooks when AI teaches better?
Translation Services (RWS Holdings) - AI already superior for 90% of use cases
Stock Photography (Shutterstock, Getty) - Midjourney/DALL-E eating their lunch
Legal Process Outsourcers - Document review was their bread and butter
Credit Bureaus (Experian, Equifax) - AI can assess creditworthiness from raw data

The Second-Order Societal Plays
If AI displaces 20-30% of white-collar work:

Vice/Addiction Plays: Gaming companies (Activision, EA), alcohol companies, cannabis stocks - idle hands and universal basic income
Security/Defence: Social unrest from mass unemployment won't be pretty
Private Education/Reskilling: Desperate parents throwing money at keeping their kids competitive

The Contrarian Defensive Plays
Companies AI Can't Easily Disrupt:

Waste Management - Someone still needs to collect bins
Elevators (Otis, Schindler) - Regulatory moat, physical maintenance required
Luxury Goods - Humans buy Hermès for status, not utility
Live Entertainment/Sports - We watch for the human drama

The Geopolitical Arbitrage
The China Angle:
If US/China decouple on AI, companies that can operate in both spheres become incredibly valuable:

ASML - Netherlands threading the needle
Samsung - South Korea playing both sides
STMicroelectronics - European semiconductor player

My Genuinely Uncomfortable Prediction
The biggest winner might be government bonds. If AI causes massive structural unemployment, we're looking at:

Permanent ZIRP/NIRP to manage social unrest
Massive fiscal spending (UBI inevitable)
Flight to safety as equity risk premiums explode

The scariest trade - Long volatility. This transition won't be smooth, and the VIX at 15-20 during the greatest technological disruption in human history seems... optimistic.


The Time-Agnostic Positioning Problem
If we accept that timing is impossible but the direction is inevitable, the game becomes:

Barbell Everything:

Long the disruptors AND the disrupted (with different weightings)
Own both the automation plays AND the "human premium" luxury stocks
Hold growth tech AND value defensives

The Volatility Harvest:
Since humans will consistently overreact to every AI announcement:

Sell vol on individual names after AI panic selling
Buy vol on indices before earnings (AI guidance chaos)
The beauty is you're right about emotion overshooting - every ChatGPT update won't actually end civilisation
