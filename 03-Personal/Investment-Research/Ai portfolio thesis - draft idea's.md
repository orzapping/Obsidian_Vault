Ai portfolio thesis - draft idea's

What Your HNW Clients Actually Need
A proper framework for navigating this WITHOUT playing prophet:

The Disruption Portfolio Construction:

20% "Arms Dealers" (NVDA, ASML, etc.) - they win regardless
20% "Incumbent Adaptors" (MSFT, Big 4 consultancies)
20% "Disruption Victims" (but generating cash NOW - milk them while you can)
20% "Anti-Fragile" (benefits from chaos - volatility, gold, gov bonds)
20% "Human Premium" (things AI makes MORE valuable - live experiences, real art, land)

The Career Hedge for Their Children:
This is what wealthy parents are actually losing sleep over. AI won't take their wealth, but it might make their Oxbridge-educated offspring unemployable. Investment thesis: Long education companies that teach AI-proof skills (trades, human care, performance).

The Uncomfortable Conversation
Message - The biggest risk isn't market volatility - it's that the existing entire wealth investment conceptual framework might be obsolete. If AI achieves even 50% of its promise, either:

Asset prices go parabolic (productivity explosion)
Asset prices become irrelevant (post-scarcity or social collapse)
The state essentially nationalises wealth (UBI funded by wealth taxes)

Traditional 60/40 portfolios are fighting the last war.
