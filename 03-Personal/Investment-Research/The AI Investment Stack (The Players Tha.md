The AI Investment Stack (The Players That Matter)
The Chip Sovereigns:

NVIDIA - The undisputed emperor, 80%+ of AI training market
ASML - The kingmaker, without them nobody makes advanced chips
TSMC - The foundry that actually builds the bloody things
AMD - Distant second but MI300X is gaining traction
Broadcom - Custom AI chips for the hyperscalers

The Cloud Oligarchs (Where AI Actually Runs):

Microsoft - OpenAI's sugar daddy, Azure AI
Google - Gemini, TPUs, vertically integrated
Amazon - AWS Bedrock, Anthropic's patron
Meta - Open source Llama play, massive compute infrastructure

The Software/Model Makers:

Microsoft (again - OpenAI exposure)
Adobe - Firefly, creative AI tools
Salesforce - Enterprise AI integration
Palantir - Government/enterprise AI (bit Marmite this one)
ServiceNow - Workflow AI automation

The Dark Horses/Emerging:

Oracle - Late to the party but throwing money at it
Tesla - If you believe the FSD/Robotics narrative
Apple - Conspicuously quiet but sitting on mountains of capability

The Indirect Beneficiaries:

Electricity/Infrastructure REITs - Data centres need power and space
Utilities - AI is absurdly power-hungry
Cooling/Infrastructure - Vertiv, Schneider Electric

The Uncomfortable Truth About AI Investing
Here's what's properly mental: most of the pure-play AI companies (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) are private. The public market exposure is either:

Arms dealers (NVIDIA, ASML)
Cloud landlords (MSFT, AMZN, GOOG)
Companies frantically bolting AI onto existing products

The valuations are also completely cooked. NVIDIA trades at 60-80x earnings because everyone's betting the AI boom continues exponentially. Any whiff of demand slowdown and these multiples will look absolutely prehistoric.

The Concentration Risk (Again):

Top 7 tech stocks are ~30% of S&P 500
Most are betting on the same AI narrative
If AI adoption is slower than expected, the correction will be biblical

The Smart Money Paradox:
Everyone knows NVIDIA is the AI play, which means it's priced like everyone knows NVIDIA is the AI play. The real money might be in second-order effects - the companies that benefit from AI adoption but aren't priced for it yet.
