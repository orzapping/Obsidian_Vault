To Anastasia..

Right so, i've decided its best i write to you instead of talking on the phone about this...there' a greater chance you actually receive and understand the message, and less chance i get upset and enraged again by your insinuations, misrepresentations, misplaced beliefs and anymore ridiculously false inferences about who i am, what i do or why i do them.

So, lets go back to yesterday.

You started the chat off by expressing uncertainty around what to do about going to Yulia etc when you land here on saturday.  After telling you i'd be happy to pick you up and drop you off from the airport and to Yulia's place.  I again suggested i'd be happy to drop you off, no problem...if you want go straight there or not.  Knowing how shit travel is, and how much i value being able to have a nice shower and freshen up after a long haul flight, i again said i would be happy to pick you up, bring you here to have a shower..i would then be happy to take you for lunch and drop you off at Yulia's place.  No problem.

*(did you somehow believe or think that You were doing Me a favour by 'allowing' me to go out of my way, pick you up like some luxury service..sacrifice my saturday in hours of driving around london and the english countryside - for Your comfort, exclusively?  Whereas I considered this whole thing a kindness that i was extending to you...something ordinary people might appreciate and be thankful for...it seems as though you've interpreted this as some kind of 'obligation' of mine...something 'expected' from me like I owe you this..?  Im offering up My time, My saturday, My weekend to make Your day easier, Your trip and travel easier - with ABSOLUTELY nothing expected in return from You - yet you treat this simple act of kindness like not only is it Nothing, or Expected, no, but instead like its some ordained unfolding of Anastasia's destiny regardless of impact, cost or inconvenience served to anyone else?)

Even though i had made this clear to you the first time, i settled your insecurity or uncertainty again, for the second time. *edit - it seems as though all i was doing here was serving up validation, confirmation and security for your benefit...not out of any concern about whether its any hassle for me...no, its all about you.  And then you txt me today..'dont bother coming to the airport tomorrow' - again, like You were the one doing Me a favour by it? - all you did is confirm how little you care about how carefully and compassionately, considerately i've continued to treat You.  And out the goodness of my own heart no less...you throw it back like you're doing Me the favour..?  unbelievable...utterly unbelievable..*

Why am i going over this?

Because i want you to understand that I care for you, for your well being safety and comfort.  I am happy to go out of my way to help you, be kind to you and show you that.  Because that is who i am, that is how i feel, that is what i do.  Happily.

But then you go, from left field, and launch a grenade into our chat and bring up an old hurt, an old scar of yours from the past.  From Way back...all the way to  the very beginning of our time together as parents.  A time in which we both suffered huge insecurity, pain and heartache.  You brought up the night you hit your head on Goodie's high chair after falling backwards after i had to push you away from me because you were physically restricting me from going downstairs to see to our baby girl, and to go to bed.  I had zero interest in being around you. at all.  I had come home from work to find you with Goodie in one had, being breast fed while you were wielding a glass of wine (bottle about 3/4 empty if i recall correctly) in the other.  You were piss drunk. if that werent bad enough, you were also still online working...for the Nazi at fxcmpro.

If that werent bad enough already, you continued drinking that night getting ever more drunk and our of control. 

I had no interest in all this shit.  i'd just got home, I was heartbroken at the state I'd found you in and wanted nothing to do with you.  I decided i was going to go to bed, and i told you as much.  But you werent having any of it.  you refused to let me go downstairs to our new born baby who was now largerly asleep downstairs, unsupervised, alone, downstairs.  You on the otherhand, were piss drunk out of your head batshit nuts...once again (a trend you'd continue til this day, some 15 years later).  I recall you were incredibly physically aggressive, you grabbed my shirt and physically yanked me away from the door to go downstairs and then proceeded to block my path so i couldnt go down.  This was of course ridiculous because you werent exactly going to stop me, so i pulled you away from the door and proceeded to make my way downstairs to our baby girl.  You once again grabbed me, aggressively pulling me away from door.  I turned around, relinquished your nine inch nails from me, and pushed you away from me...giving me just enough time to finally get away from you and go downstairs.

	Now, what i didnt know - until some time later when the cops were in our apartment (another trend you'd start and continue..to this very day) - was that when i pushed you away from me at the door, you had stumbled backwards into Goodie's highchairs...you'd clearly lost your footing and fallen back..and hit your head on the corner of the high chair. Obviously horrible and obviously not something I could ever have wanted to happen - yet you went on to spend every day of our relationship, marriage resenting me..hating me, for that!  Believing that I had somehow intentionally caused that all to happen!  How can you possibly think, or believe that Anastasia?  How is it possible that you can honestly believe that I orchestrated that whole sequence of events that resulted in you hitting your head on the high chair after stumbling backwards and tripping into and onto the high chair..losing your balance, falling down and bashing your head on the edge of the chair..causing a tiny gash on your head.  How can you, no, how Dare you believe I ever had any intention for that to happen?!  How could i possibly be guilty of deliberately wanting you to get hurt?  For fuck sakes Anastasia...all i wanted was to get away from you, go and be with our new born baby girl, and go to sleep beside her. It is tragic and unfortunate that I had to physically unhinge your claws from me and push you away in order to give me enough time to actually get through the door!  That you ended up getting hurt as a result of that was truly unfortunate and I of course never had any intention for that to happen.  However Anastasia - and here's something you seem completely unable to comprehend, appreciate or accept - there is no conceivable way i ever could halence of events would ever happen, nor that you would stumble over the chair..lose your footing...fall backwards and bump your head causing a tiny bleeding gash that was so small that after you had managed to get me arrested for the event, not even the hospital that the cops took you to afterwards had any conviction to do anything about except clean it up.  Tragic?  sure.  Unfortunate?  of course!  Deliberate, or intentional?  How could you ever believe so...?  Honestly?

Now there's 2 more things i want to say here:

	1. This is the second time in 2 days i've had to go through this tragic part of our past - and this will be the very last time - ever.  You will no doubt have some entirely alternate version in your head...and go on to declare me a liar..again... and thats fine.  i am not going to argue with you about this, ever again; and Im not going to discuss this horrible damn evening agian, ever.  That is the truth - for the record.
	2. That you felt compelled to bring this tragic story up..in a whatsapp chat with me (again) after 5 years of being seperated and divorced - is entirely beyond me.  I totally and completely cannot comprehend why you need to bring up this hurt and tragedy of our past with me - on whatsapp while otherwise having - or at least attempting to have - a civil and lighthearted conversation and chat.  And that you expect me NOT to resond to your aaccusation - once again - that that event was tantamount to 'abuse' and somehow intentional is also something that i cannot and will not accept.  which is why i responded to you the way i did.


In any event, you went on to exhibit surprise that i had responded the way i did.  Then you had the cheek to tell me to calm down and continue only 'when you're normal'.  Like it was Me who through a handgrenade into the chat and expected you not to notice or react?  what the fuck Anastasia?

Why are you bringing this stuff up - now?  We are not together, we havent been for years now.  You got what you wanted, when you wanted it - and that was an end to our relationship, our marriage and our family.  I have been trying so hard, over and over again to keep things civil, honest and clean between us since you killed our family in the december of 2020.  I do it not only for the sake of our daughters, not only for the sake of keeping things civil, no, because i want to Anastasia.  I want to, because i care for you, i want the best for you, i want to be there for you, i want to help and support you and be there when you fall, be there when you are low and feeling depressed...I was there for you when you went off the reserve and got yourself arrested a few weeks back and now, apparently, have a criminal record for what?  for 'child abuse'.  (For fuck sakes Anastasia!?) How many more times are you going to insist on pushing the people in your life that love and care for you - away?

Why do you do this?

Its such a shame.

But then, after all that..it gets worse!  After launching that hand-grenade into our chat not only causing unnecessary drama, anxiety, hurt and anger...you then proceed to makes things even worse in our chat convo last night/yesterday...

You then sabotage our chat even further by bring up Cheryl.  Again.  Now once again Anastasia i must ask...Why? Why do you do this?  why are you bringing up yet another pain point from our past?   Anastasia!  You ended our marriage 5 years ago!  You literally get on the phone and tell me about your fucking dating escapades with other men like its something i want to hear... but in the same breath you brutally throw all our past history in my face and punish me for it all over again...for the umpteenth time no less! its like you cant stop yourself from continuing over and over and over and over again to punish me for the same shit...for the same misplaced, misremembered fabricated lies you tell yourself in your head to justify all the despicable crazy self destructive shit you do...

Im done Anastasia.  I am SO done being your punching bag. You have zero respect for me anastasia, clearly.  Nothing.  otherwise you wouldnt treat me like this.  you wouldnt continue to punish me for our past, over and over again...even after you laid down the ultimate punishment by ending our marriage, ending our beautiful little family the way you did those 5 years ago now.  what is wrong with you?  why are you like this?

But no...you insist on making things even worse...

And here's how you did it...

So after the drama of dredging up our painful and tragic past, we forge on in our chat last night up to and including the Spotify-saga...

Oh and here's where it gets altogether batshit crazy...

So, while you're playing around with the latest spotify wrapped...and asking me to instruct you on how to share it with me...im in the background desperately trying to get the damn spotify bill paid.  Why?  because when i had opened spotify earlier to help you 'share' a simple playlist, i had been confronted by a bright Red message telling me that i was in arrears and spotify was unable to collect payment.  Now, at this stage i have no idea why this is...so i went about investigating this.  It went on for well over an hour...it was massively annoying and painful (just to add injury to insult after all that had prevailed in our earlier chat..) even more drama and misery because i cant get the bloody spotify bill paid!

And why is it you may ask, that i was unable to pay the spotify bill?

I'll tell you...

Because there was something wrong with the card i have on file for the monthly direct debit.  An amex card to be precise.

But i persevered trying to resolve this issue because the bright red warning on spotify said there was a threat to losing all the data in the account if it was not paid immediately.

Now, the issue was not payment.  No.  The issue was i needed to pay the account using a USA $ card, with a US address!  I know that because i cannot change the card details or address to a UK one, because WE then lose that account!

The issue here Anastasia, in case you hadnt clocked it, is simply that this account holds ALL spotify accounts for YOU, Ella and Tiny!  Why, because its a Family account i've been paying for for the last 7 or 8 years.

But, i dont use spotify anymore.  I use apple music.  

So i am preserving this spotify account exclusively for YOU and the girls.

read that again Anastasia - YOU and the girls.

I am doing this for several reasons..

1. love
2. kindness
3. continuity - so you all dont lose your playlists...your annual spotify wrapped playlists..etc.  this stuff is all meaningful and important.  if not to you, then definitely for the girls.

But onwards we go....

...after wrestling with this problem for well over an hour and a half at this point...unable to get my amex card to work because there is some 'technical issue' with the phone app so i cant remedy whatever the issue was...im unable to use/fix the card i've always used for this payment.  a card i otherwise never use.  ever.  its just for spotify and to keep your accounts safe.

But then i decided the only option is to change cards, update addresses and all the approvals and logins, confirmations, security checks..2fa codes that entails.

I decide to do this, fetch my other cards and start the process. But, then...something dawns on me....

I suddenly get this thought...i wonder if anastasia would hesitate to put me out of this misery and pay this for me quickly?  I'd pay it back of course, immediately.  i just wanted to know if there was ' ***any shred of kindness, concern, care that she felt for me?  was there ANY reciprocation for the feelings and wants that i have...shared by Anastasia, back to me?  would she even hesitate to grant me this simple kindness...*** - by relieving the misery of dealing with all this shit...for the sake of Her and the girls spotify accounts? 

Well i got the answer to that question quite quickly...

...and it was Brutal!

And it shocked me so much i actually got a bit lightheaded.  I could not believe that you had launched into the pathetic diatribe...moaning about going down that rabbit hole.. sharing finances with an ex... 'no thanks!'... then accusing me of being irresponsible (??)...bitching about not being 'linked to me financially'...accusing me of being 'like my dad'...then moving on to reminding me about 'what i had to do in 2021'....?

but that wasnt enough no..you had to take it even further...

you then went  on another rant about ' no fucking way will any man do that to me again!'...and the best part...

*'every man always fucks me over!' ....* 

So lets recap here..in case you've lost the plot (again) Anastasia...

1. I wanted to see if you were able, capable of extending me even the smallest kindness in return.  I have gone out of my way to be kind, considerate, caring to you.  not because i feel i have to, no - because i Want to.  Because i actually care about you and want the best for you.  I am happy to continue paying for the annual Amazon account that only you and the girls use...i am happy to pay for the spotify account that only you and the girls use... I am happy to take time out of my weekend to drive and pick you up from heathrow airport..bring you back here to have a shower and freshen up... then take you into London (a 2 and a half hour round trip driving hell into and out of london!) - no problem, i'll do that for Anastasia because thats who i am.  plain and simple.  
2. You not only refused.. you entered into some psychotic rant not only refusing a simple..temporary $19 CC charge that would immediately be reimbursed, no.  You chose, firmly - to show me that you would absolutely under no circumstances never ever extend even the smallest kindness to me.

Anastasia..you have *NO* idea how much of a massive punch to the stomach that was...

	*Shocked*!
	..total disbelief..i could not beleive you just did that...  not for a second did i suspect you'd react like that.

Anyway, that shock very quickly turned to hurt anastasia.  Hurt - with a capital fucking H!.  

I have been compassionate, caring and sincere with you.  always ready to help..always ready to talk to you... to do whatever to make your life a little easier and more pleasant.  Why?  because i know you have it tough Anastasia.  I know that.  But, i also know that it is all entirley YOUR fault, and your choosing!  Your life, at the moment Anastasia is all a result and consequence of the choices YOU made and make - all of them.  Every single one.

And I am not responsible for that - at all.  But yet i chose to be there for you, to offer support in whichever way i can...whether its just being there for you to speak to...to joke with..to just pretend like its all okay...to joke and be playful with you if even just for a brief moment.  Because in that moment perhaps you'll forget about all the heartache of life, the past and the present...and the future.  I do it... out of Love Anastasia.  if thats not clear...

Love.

Not the kind you find in early relationships...which is infatuation, lust, obsession.  No, the kind you develop with time...patience, compassion and caring for someone.  the kind you develop when you face life together and get through all the heartache and pain but still wake up next to one another and face the brutality of life - together.  the Love one finds in having children together.  the kind of Love one mourns when a marriage fails...when a family is broken.  

the kind of love one never truly loses...

it just gets put in a box that now gets stored in the attic of ones heart.

The kind of love that inspires compassion, caring, kindness, sincerity and concern... All the things i have had for you Anastasia... well past and through all these years of being apart/divorced.. and in spite of all the pain that i carry every day because of it all - and most importantly DESPITE it all.

No, i still offer you that kindness, that caring, that compassion. And i do it all without hesitation.  every time.  Because it is entirely natural, honest and clean.  untainted by any lies, dishonesty, anger or hatred whatsoever.

What i learned last night Anastasia..is that You have none of that for me.  Nothing at all.

All you carry for me is hatred, contempt, anger and resentment. edit - and, it seems, a whole load of 'expectation' that i am some external resource, slave, punching-bag that you tap into to extract whatever value, resource, money, validation you need in that moment...or to settle some 'insecurity' you're currently feeling.  You Use me anastasia...without any regard or concern for me, my feelings, my emotions, my well-being - whatsoever!  You simply dont care one bit.  You launch wild accusations, you hurl lies and distortions of the truth at me, you belittle me, you insult me...you hurt me with reckless abandon like its some fanciful hobby of yours.  All the while all i want for you is to be safe..to be happy..to be comfortable...to be there for you...to help you, to comfort you when you're in pain or sad.  To try and relieve some of the hardship of life you are experiencing.  I do it because i care.  I do it out of genuine love and concern for you.  Today/last night i came to the brutal painful realisation that you share none of those wants or feelings for me.  You clearly carry so much hatred and resentment for me that you cant even bring yourself to spare me even the smallest of acts of kindness...even ones that cost you Nothing are still too much for you to bring yourself to extend to me.  Not even after I satisfy your insecurity/uncertainty about picking you up from the airport and giving you a day of comfort that you wouldnt have otherwise had but for me taking My time out of My day to give those things to you.  No, even after all that, you treat me like absolutley no regard, care or compassion whatsoever.

Even after all these years... 5 years almost exactly now...since you ended our marriage, our family, or partnership...our love.

You still only carry all the bitterness, resentment, hatred...

..and that kills me Anastasia.  it really does.  and last night it kicked like a mule!  after the shock had warn off...those feelings turned into bleeding hurt...pain, like i havent felt for many years really...probably not since that december of 2020 when you took your chance and ended our union forever.

I did not expect that Anastasia.  At all.  Not for a second did i expect you to demonstrate what little care you had left... you couldnt offer up even the smallest of kindnesses to me...not even after all that i have given to you so naturally and unflinchingly even years after you ended our union.  I have given you those things without a second thought...without blinking and with the fullness and openness of my entire heart.  without a second thought.

Last night you proved i have been very stupid.  even after all these years you proved that you would punish even the smallest of vulnerabilities shown to you, by me.  even if it was a contrived experiment that popped into my head..out of the blue..almost like an angel gifting me this idea as if to finally free me from your torment in spite of all the love and kindness i have offered up to you effortlessly and wholeheartedly after all these years.

No, clearly this was meant to happen. i was meant to find out last night that you carry nothing but hatred and resentment for me and any kindness offered up by me, to you...is an un-reciprocated toxic sacrifice of my heart, to someone who clearly couldn't give even the slightest fuck about it, or me.  You laugh and scoff at my compassion, concern, love and caring i still harbour for you...after all these years...after all we've been through..after all the raging pain and hurt you've subjected to me over the years in punishment for fabricated lies you've chosen to believe over the truth...still you insist on punishing me for every kindness i offer up to you.

Well Anastasia, no longer...

I am no longer going to subject myself to someone who clearly has no regard for me whatsoever.

So yes Anastasia i think its a good idea you find your own way from the airport tomorrow.

And no, i wasnt sharing our conflicts with just anyone..after i sent you the amazon code (this morning - that you asked for), i must have hit the voice recording function (on whatsapp) while i was recounting the horror story and discovery i had with you last night, to my brother  (Yes, to Mark. ) ..and somehow managed to send it to you as well..  (i mean really...how this happens to me is completely beyond me..) but probably just a prelude for You in preparation to stir enough anger and resentment in you to face this letter im about to send to you - which you will of course interpret and respond to with all the animosity, anger, resentment and hatred you so clearly have for me...  

Admittedly i was going to speak to you about this.. on the phone - but it dawned on me there is no way i'd ever be able to get it all out -  without you misinterpreting what i said or meant..and of course you shifting the goalpost as you so categorically and apologetically do...time and time again..over and over.  because you cant have an honest conversation anastasia...can you?..with anyone?  You cant say sorry...you cant drum up even the smallest of empathy or concern for anyone, even your own daughters and *most certainly not for me*.  You've proved that more often than i'd like to admit.  yet i've always given you the benefit of the doubt.

Silly me.

But not this time Anastasia.  

Not this time.
Not ever again.

You have lost all rights to my good nature, my compassion, concern, care or love.  I've clearly wasted it all - even years after you burning down our marriage and family - the little i had left i still shared with you.  Yet all you did was respond with the recklessness of a heartless, compassion-less monster.

I deserve more than that Anastasia.  Much more. 

So I'm going to move forward in my life, gently heal the damage you've so cruelly, savagely inflicted on me and move on.  I will treat you with the most basic of civility and respect that you deserve - both in terms of our respective status' and with crystal clear reference to the vile hateful animosity and disregard you so clearly have for me.

Goodbye.

Adrian.
